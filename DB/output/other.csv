38764024,Using image segmentation models to analyse high-resolution earth observation data: new tools to monitor disease risks in changing environments,"Trujillano F, Jimenez G, Manrique E, Kahamba NF, Okumu F, Apollinaire N, Carrasco-Escobar G, Barrett B, Fornace K.",Int J Health Geogr. 2024 May 19;23(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s12942-024-00371-w.,Trujillano F,Int J Health Geogr,2024,2024/05/19,PMC11102859,,10.1186/s12942-024-00371-w,"BACKGROUND: In the near future, the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases may expand to new sites due to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns caused by climate change. Therefore, there is a need to use recent technological advances to improve vector surveillance methodologies. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), often called drones, have been used to collect high-resolution imagery to map detailed information on mosquito habitats and direct control measures to specific areas. Supervised classification approaches have been largely used to automatically detect vector habitats. However, manual data labelling for model training limits their use for rapid responses. Open-source foundation models such as the Meta AI Segment Anything Model (SAM) can facilitate the manual digitalization of high-resolution images. This pre-trained model can assist in extracting features of interest in a diverse range of images. Here, we evaluated the performance of SAM through the Samgeo package, a Python-based wrapper for geospatial data, as it has not been applied to analyse remote sensing images for epidemiological studies.
RESULTS: We tested the identification of two land cover classes of interest: water bodies and human settlements, using different UAV acquired imagery across five malaria-endemic areas in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. We employed manually placed point prompts and text prompts associated with specific classes of interest to guide the image segmentation and assessed the performance in the different geographic contexts. An average Dice coefficient value of 0.67 was obtained for buildings segmentation and 0.73 for water bodies using point prompts. Regarding the use of text prompts, the highest Dice coefficient value reached 0.72 for buildings and 0.70 for water bodies. Nevertheless, the performance was closely dependent on each object, landscape characteristics and selected words, resulting in varying performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent models such as SAM can potentially assist manual digitalization of imagery by vector control programs, quickly identifying key features when surveying an area of interest. However, accurate segmentation still requires user-provided manual prompts and corrections to obtain precise segmentation. Further evaluations are necessary, especially for applications in rural areas.",other,[]

Epub 2024 May 4.,Schoenhof R,J Dent,2024,2024/05/06,,,10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105042,"OBJECTIVES: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce synthetic images free from personal data. They hold significant value in medical research, where data protection is increasingly regulated. Panoramic radiographs (PRs) are a well-suited modality due to their significant level of standardization while simultaneously displaying a high degree of personally identifiable data.
METHODS: We produced synthetic PRs (syPRs) out of real PRs (rePRs) using StyleGAN2-ADA by NVIDIAÂ©. A survey was performed on 54 medical professionals and 33 dentistry students. They assessed 45 radiological images (20 rePRs, 20 syPRs, and 5 syPRcontrols) as real or synthetic and interpreted a single-image syPR according to the image quality (0-10) and 14 different items (agreement/disagreement). They also rated the importance for the profession (0-10). A follow-up was performed for test-retest reliability with >10 % of all participants.
RESULTS: Overall, the sensitivity was 78.2 % and the specificity was 82.5 %. For professionals, the sensitivity was 79.9 % and the specificity was 82.3 %. For students, the sensitivity was 75.5 % and the specificity was 82.7 %. In the single syPR-interpretation image quality was rated at a median of 6 and 11 items were considered as agreement. The importance for the profession was rated at a median score of 7. The Test-retest reliability yielded a value of 0.23 (Cohen's kappa).
CONCLUSIONS: The study marks a comprehensive testing to demonstrate that GANs can produce synthetic radiological images that even health professionals can sometimes not differentiate from real radiological images, thereby being genuinely considered authentic. This enables their utilization and/or modification free from personally identifiable information.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Synthetic images can be used for university teaching and patient education without relying on patient-related data. They can also be utilized to upscale existing training datasets to improve the accuracy of AI-based diagnostic systems. The study thereby supports clinical teaching as well as diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making.",other,"['generative', 'generative adversarial network']"

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in neurogenesis, learning and memory. The reduction of BDNF is associated with the decrease in cognitive function in various neurological disorders. Few pre-clinical studies have reported on the effects of chemotherapy and medical stress on BDNF levels and cognition. The present study aimed to compare the effects of medical stress and cisplatin on serum BDNF levels and cognitive function in 9-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats to age-matched controls. Serum BDNF levels were collected longitudinally during cisplatin treatment, and cognitive function was assessed by novel object recognition (NOR) 14Â weeks post-cisplatin initiation. Terminal BDNF levels were collected 24Â weeks after cisplatin initiation. In cultured hippocampal neurons, we screened three neuroprotective agents, riluzole (an approved treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as the ampakines CX546 and CX1739. We assessed dendritic arborization by Sholl analysis and dendritic spine density by quantifying postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) puncta. Cisplatin and exposure to medical stress reduced serum BDNF levels and impaired object discrimination in NOR compared to age-matched controls. Pharmacological BDNF augmentation protected neurons against cisplatin-induced reductions in dendritic branching and PSD-95. Ampakines (CX546 and CX1739) and riluzole did not affect the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in vitro. In conclusion, we established the first middle-aged rat model of cisplatin-induced CRCI, assessing the contribution of medical stress and longitudinal changes in BDNF levels on cognitive function, although future studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of BDNF enhancement in vivo on synaptic plasticity. Collectively, our results indicate that cancer treatment exerts long-lasting changes in BDNF levels, and support BDNF enhancement as a potential preventative approach to target CRCI with therapeutics that are FDA approved and/or in clinical study for other indications.",other,"['dl', 'object recognition', 'object recognition']"

The high mortality rate of some types of skin cancers needs to be detected in the early stages and treated urgently. The use of neural network ensembles for the detection of objects of interest in images has gained more and more interest due to the increased performance of the results. In this sense, this paper proposes two ensembles of neural networks, based on the fusion of the decisions of the component neural networks for the detection of four skin lesions (basal cancer cell, melanoma, benign keratosis, and melanocytic nevi). The first system is based on separate learning of three neural networks (MobileNet V2, DenseNet 169, and EfficientNet B2), with multiple weights for the four classes of lesions and weighted overall prediction. The second system is made up of six binary models (one for each pair of classes) for each network; the fusion and prediction are conducted by weighted summation per class and per model. In total, 18 such binary models will be considered. The 91.04% global accuracy of this set of binary models is superior to the first system (89.62%). Separately, only for the binary classifications within the system was the individual accuracy better. The individual F1 score for each class and the global system varied from 81.36% to 94.17%. Finally, a critical comparison is made with similar works from the literature.",other,"['neural network', 'ensemble']"

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and test an automatic assessment of lung impairment in COVID-19 associated pneumonia with machine learning regression models that predict markers of respiratory and cardiovascular functioning from radiograms and lung CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled a total of 605 COVID-19 cases admitted to Al Ain Hospital from 24 February to 1 July 2020 into the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age â¥ 18 years; inpatient admission; PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung CT available at PACS. We designed a CNN-based regression model to predict systemic oxygenation markers from lung CT and 2D diagnostic images of the chest. The 2D images generated by averaging CT scans were analogous to the frontal and lateral view radiograms. The functional (heart and breath rate, blood pressure) and biochemical findings (SpO<sub>2</sub>, H C O 3 -   , K +, Na +, anion gap, C-reactive protein) served as ground truth.
RESULTS: Radiologic findings in the lungs of COVID-19 patients provide reliable assessments of functional status with clinical utility. If fed to ML models, the sagittal view radiograms reflect dyspnea more accurately than the coronal view radiograms due to the smaller size and the lower model complexity. Mean absolute error of the models trained on single-projection radiograms was approximately 11Ã·12% and it dropped by 0.5Ã·1% if both projections were used (11.97 Â± 9.23 vs. 11.43 Â± 7.51%; p = 0.70). Thus, the ML regression models based on 2D images acquired in multiple planes had slightly better performance. The data blending approach was as efficient as the voting regression technique: 10.90 Â± 6.72 vs. 11.96 Â± 8.30%, p = 0.94. The models trained on 3D images were more accurate than those on 2D: 8.27 Â± 4.13 and 11.75 Â± 8.26%, p = 0.14 before lung extraction; 10.66 Â± 5.83 and 7.94 Â± 4.13%, p = 0.18 after the extraction. The lung extraction boosts 3D model performance unsubstantially (from 8.27 Â± 4.13 to 7.94 Â± 4.13%; p = 0.82). However, none of the differences between 3D and 2D were statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The constructed ML algorithms can serve as models of structure-function association and pathophysiologic changes in COVID-19. The algorithms can improve risk evaluation and disease management especially after oxygen therapy that changes functional findings. Thus, the structural assessment of acute lung injury speaks of disease severity.",other,[]

Most countries are still facing several issues due to this disease, which has resulted in several fatalities. The first COVID-19 wave caused devastation across the world owing to its virulence and led to a massive loss in human lives, impacting the country's economy drastically. A dangerous disease called mucormycosis was discovered worldwide during the second COVID-19 wave, in 2021, which lasted from April to July. The mucormycosis disease is commonly known as ""black fungus,"" which belongs to the fungus family Mucorales. It is usually a rare disease, but the level of destruction caused by the disease is vast and unpredictable. This disease mainly targets people already suffering from other diseases and consuming heavy medication to counter the disease they are suffering from. This is because of the reduction in antibodies in the affected people. Therefore, the patient's body does not have the ability to act against fungus-oriented infections. This black fungus is more commonly identified in patients with coronavirus disease in certain country. The condition frequently manifests on skin, but it can also harm organs such as eyes and brain. This study intends to design a modified neural network logic for an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy with learning principles, called a hybrid learning-based neural network classifier (HLNNC). The proposed method is based on well-known techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM). This article discusses a dataset containing several eye photographs of patients with and without black fungus infection. These images were collected from the real-time records of people afflicted with COVID followed by the black fungus. This proposed HLNNC scheme identifies the black fungus disease based on the following image processing procedures: image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification; these procedures were performed considering the dataset training and testing principles with proper performance analysis. The results of the procedure are provided in a graphical format with the precise specification, and the efficacy of the proposed method is established.",other,"['image processing', 'image processing', 'neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'convolutional neural network']"

This work aimed to investigate the sensory, affective, cognitive, and motor changes induced by an adaptation of the CCI model by applying a single ligature around the sciatic nerve.
METHODS: Mechanical allodynia was measured from day 1 to day 28 postsurgery by the von Frey test. The beam walking test (BWT) was conducted weekly until 28âdays after surgery.Â Anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and cognitive performance were assessed through the open field (OF), forced swimming (FS), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests, respectively, 21âdays after surgery.
RESULTS: The two CCI models, both Bennett and Xie's model (four ligatures of the sciatic nerve) and a modification of it (one ligature), induced mechanical allodynia, increased immobility in the FS, and reduced recognition index in the NOR. The exploratory behavior and time spent in the central part of the arena decreased, while the defensive behavior increased in the OF. The animals subjected to the two CCI models showed motor alterations in the BWT; however, autotomy was observed only in the group with four ligatures and not in the group with a single ligature.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall these results demonstrate that our adapted CCI model, using a single ligature around the sciatic nerve, induces sensory, affective, cognitive, and motor alterations comparable to the CCI model with four ligatures without generating autotomy. This adaptation to the CCI model may therefore represent an appropriate and more easily performed model for inducing neuropathic pain and study underlying mechanisms and effective treatments.",other,"['object recognition', 'object recognition']"

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including patients initially diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (CP) within a regional integrated healthcare system between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Imaging reports from these patients were extracted from the electronic medical record system and split into training, validation and implementation datasets. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was first developed through the training dataset to identify specific features (atrophy, calcification, pseudocyst, cyst and main duct dilatation) from free-text radiology reports. The validation dataset was applied to validate the performance by comparing against the manual chart review. The developed algorithm was then applied to the implementation dataset. We classified patients with calcification(s) or â¥2 radiographic features as advanced CP. We compared etiology, comorbid conditions, treatment parameters as well as survival between advanced CP and others diagnosed during the study period.
RESULTS: 6,346 patients were diagnosed with CP during the study period with 58,085 radiology studies performed. For individual features, NLP yielded sensitivity from 88.7% to 95.3%, specificity from 98.2% to 100.0%. A total of 3,672 patients met cohort inclusion criteria: 1,330 (36.2%) had evidence of advanced CP. Patients with advanced CP had increased frequency of smoking (57.8% vs. 43.0%), diabetes (47.6% vs. 35.9%) and underweight body mass index (6.6% vs. 3.6%), all p<0.001. Mortality from pancreatic cancer was higher in advanced CP (15.3/1,000 person-year vs. 2.8/1,000, p<0.001). Underweight BMI (HR 1.6, 95% CL 1.2, 2.1), smoking (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.1, 1.7) and diabetes (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.2, 1.6) were independent risk factors for mortality.
CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced CP experienced increased disease-related complications and pancreatic cancer-related mortality. Excess all-cause mortality was driven primarily by potentially modifiable risk factors including malnutrition, smoking and diabetes.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

This ultimately can lead to deficits in multiple cognitive domains commonly referred to as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Clinical diagnosis of such deficits requires detailed neuropsychological assessment but clinical signs may be difficult to detect during asymptomatic injury of the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore neuroimaging biomarkers are of particular interest in HAND. In this study, we constructed brain connectivity profiles of 40Â subjects (20 HIV positive subjects and 20 age-matched seronegative controls) using two different methods: a non-linear mutual connectivity analysis approach and a conventional method based on Pearson's correlation. These profiles were then summarized using graph-theoretic methods characterizing their topological network properties. Standard clinical and laboratory assessments were performed and a battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests was administered for all participating subjects. Based on NP testing, 14 of the seropositive subjects exhibited mild neurologic impairment. Subsequently, we analyzed associations between the network derived measures and neuropsychological assessment scores as well as common clinical laboratory plasma markers (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA) after adjusting for age and gender. Mutual connectivity analysis derived graph-theoretic measures, Modularity and Small Worldness, were significantly (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05, FDR adjusted) associated with the Executive as well as Overall z-score of NP performance. In contrast, network measures derived from conventional correlation-based connectivity did not yield any significant results. Thus, changes in connectivity can be captured using advanced time-series analysis techniques. The demonstrated associations between imaging-derived graph-theoretic properties of brain networks with neuropsychological performance, provides opportunities to further investigate the evolution of HAND in larger, longitudinal studies. Our analysis approach, involving non-linear time-series analysis in conjunction with graph theory, is promising and it may prove to be useful not only in HAND but also in other neurodegenerative disorders.",other,['generative']

The biggest challenge is to distinguish communicating hydrocephalus from ventricular dilatation secondary to brain atrophy, because both conditions share common clinical and neuroradiological features. The main purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between ventriculomegaly, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, aqueductal and cervical CSF flows, and CSF opening pressure in MPS patients, and to provide potential biomarkers for abnormal CSF circulation.
METHODS: Forty-three MPS patients (12 MPS I, 15 MPS II, 5 MPS III, 9 MPS IV A and 2 MPS VI) performed clinical and developmental tests, and T1, T2, FLAIR and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by a lumbar puncture with the CSF opening pressure assessment. For the analysis of MRI variables, we measured the brain and CSF volumes, white matter (WM) lesion load, Evans' index, third ventricle width, callosal angle, dilated perivascular spacesÂ (PVS), craniocervical junction stenosis, aqueductal and cervical CSF stroke volumes, and CSF glycosaminoglycans concentration.
RESULTS: All the scores used to assess the supratentorial ventricles enlargement and the ventricular CSF volume presented a moderate correlation with the aqueductal CSF stroke volume (ACSV). The CSF opening pressure did not correlate either with the three measures of ventriculomegaly, or the ventricular CSF volume, or with the ACSV. Dilated PVS showed a significant association with the ventriculomegaly, ventricular CSF volume and elevated ACSV.
CONCLUSIONS: In MPS patients ventriculomegaly is associated with a severe phenotype, increased cognitive decline, WM lesion severity and enlarged PVS. The authors have shown that there are associations between CSF flow measurements and measurements related to CSF volumetrics. There was also an association of volumetric measurements with the degree of dilated PVS.",other,[]

The clinical presentations and MR findings in children with AADC deficiency were investigated. Total 12 children (6 boys, 6 girls), aged from 9 to 50 months (mean, 23 Â±13 months), with AADC deficiency, were enrolled for analysis. Of 12 patients enrolled, clinical presentations included global developmental delay with generalized hypotonia in 12 (100%), dystonia in 12 (100%), oculogyric crisis in 12 (100%), and excessive sweating in 8 (67%). Sleep problem was also found in 4 (33%). Of 15 MR examinations, the major changes included 6 (40%) with diffusely prominent bilateral frontal sulci, 10 (67%) with prominent frontal horns, and 12 (80%) with hypomyelination. In AADC patients, the frontal horn was significantly widened (Pâ<â0.01), and the volume of caudate nucleus was also significantly smaller than that of controls (Pâ=â0.02). The ratios of thickness of the splenium to that of the genu of corpus callosum were also significantly increased (Pâ<â0.01). There was also significant decrease of fiber density indices in major white matter fiber tracts.

METHODS: Six- and 12-month changes in regional MRI volumes and PSP Rating Scale scores were examined in 55 patients with PSP and 33 patients with CBS (78% amyloid PET negative) compared to 30 normal controls from a multicenter natural history study. Longitudinal voxel-based morphometric analyses identified patterns of volume loss, and region-of-interest analyses examined rates of volume loss in brainstem (midbrain, pons, superior cerebellar peduncle), cortical, and subcortical regions based on previously validated atlases. Results were compared to those in a replication cohort of 226 patients with PSP with MRI data from the AL-108-231 clinical trial.
RESULTS: Patients with CBS exhibited greater baseline atrophy and greater longitudinal atrophy rates in cortical and basal ganglia regions than patients with PSP; however, midbrain and pontine atrophy rates were similar. Voxel-wise analyses showed distinct patterns of regional longitudinal atrophy in each group as compared to normal controls. The midbrain/pons volumetric ratio differed between diagnoses but remained stable over time. In both patient groups, brainstem atrophy rates were correlated with disease progression measured using the PSP Rating Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Volume loss is quantifiable over a period of 6 months in CBS and PSP. Future clinical trials may be able to combine CBS and PSP to measure therapeutic effects.",other,[]

In this present report, the VDAC protein 1 from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (designated as CiVDAC1) was found to be upregulated by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein analysis of infected C.Â idella kidney (CIK) cells. The full-length cDNA of CiVDAC1 was 995Â bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 852Â bp that encodes a putative 283-amino acid protein. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the complete ORF of CiVDAC1 demonstrated high identity with well characterized mammalian homologs. The deduced CiVDAC1 protein contains an Î±-helix at the amino terminal, 19 membrane-spanning Î²-strands, and one eukaryotic mitochondrial porin signature motif. Tissue tropism analysis indicated that CiVDAC1 is abundant in muscle, heart, skin, swim bladder, trunk kidney and spleen. Transcriptional expression profiles indicated that the CiVDAC1 gene was upregulated upon viral challenge in a manner similar to the Mx2 gene, which is a marker gene used to indicate activation of innate antiviral immunity. Similar expression patterns of the CiVDAC1 gene were observed in CIK cells stimulated with poly (I:C), as well as grass carp kidney tissue challenged with GCRV inÂ vivo. CiVDAC1 silencing in CIK cells had no impact on progeny virus production, but over-expression of CiVDAC1 inÂ vivo showed strongly protect against challenge with live virus. To interpret the role of other VDAC proteins in viral pathogenesis, CiVDAC2 was characterized and showed to respond positively to GCRV challenge, which suggested that CiVDAC2 might functionally complement CiVDAC1 in C.Â idella. The present data did demonstrate that CiVDAC1 might be mediated grass carp antiviral immune response.",other,[]

However, the changes in brain structure that accompany normal aging, and the role they play in cognitive decline, remain to be fully elucidated.
AIMS: This study aims to characterize changes in brain structure in old age, and to investigate relationships between brain aging and cognitive decline using the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Here, we report the rationale, design and methodology of the brain and neurovascular imaging protocol developed to study this cohort.
DESIGN: An observational, longitudinal study of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, which comprises 1091 relatively healthy individuals now in their 70s and living in the Edinburgh area. They are surviving participants of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947, which involved a test of general intelligence taken at age 11 years. At age 70 years, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 undertook detailed cognitive, medical and genetic testing, and provided social, family, nutritional, quality of life and physical activity information. At mean age 73 years they underwent detailed brain MRI and neurovascular ultrasound imaging, repeat cognitive and other testing. The MRI protocol is designed to provide qualitative and quantitative measures of gray and white matter atrophy, severity and location of white matter lesions, enlarged perivascular spaces, brain mineral deposits, microbleeds and integrity of major white matter tracts. The neurovascular ultrasound imaging provides velocity, stenosis and intima-media thickness measurements of the carotid and vertebral arteries.
STUDY: This valuable imaging dataset will be used to determine which changes in brain structural parameters have the largest effects on cognitive aging. Analysis will include multimodal image analysis and multivariate techniques, such as factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Especially valuable is the ability within this sample to examine the influence that early life intelligence has on brain structural parameters in old age, and the role of genetic, vascular, educational and lifestyle factors.
OUTCOMES: Final outcomes include associations between early and late life cognition and integrity of key white matter tracts, volume of gray and white matter, myelination, brain water content, and visible abnormalities such as white matter lesions and mineral deposits; and influences of vascular risk factors, diet, environment, social metrics, education and genetics on healthy brain aging. It is intended that this information will help to inform and develop strategies for successful cognitive aging.",other,"['dl', 'multimodal']"

The patient is laid on the right side at an angle of 30-45 degrees in order to obtain an artefact-free image of the close anatomical relationship around the pancreas head. In addition, curved MPRs or in rare cases 3D reconstructions could be very helpful in identifying the critical anatomic tumor site in the neighbourhood of the visceral vessel system. After the correct diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma has been made only 20% of all patients are shown to have a surgically resectable disease, but the overall survival rate is significantly higher after resection in combination with a multimodal tumor therapy strategy. The reason is that the correct diagnosis of the resectability of the tumor is one of the main criteria for overall survival of these patients. Currently practically all pancreatic tumors can be detected using MDCT and the detection rate varies between 70% and 100% (most recent literature references give a sensitivity of 89% and specificity up to 99%). In some rare cases the differentiation between focal necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma can be difficult even with sophisticated protocols. Resectability can be correctly diagnosed with MDCT with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 89%. MDCT is an ideal tool for the detection of neuroendocrine tumors, metastases and for the differentiation of cystic pancreatic lesions such as pseudocysts, microcystic adenomas or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). Particularly, the differentiation of the latter into benign, borderline or malignant transformation is not always possible, but indirect signs, such as small nodules adjacent to the ductal wall, the diameter of the pancreatic duct, or a direct communication between cystic lesions and duct can be detected because of the high spatial resolution and is comparable to the findings in MRI. Moreover MD-CT is an ideal procedure for the differentiation of local tumor stages in patients under neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.",other,['multimodal']

Unfortunately, it is difficult to prospectively identify, using objective criteria, patients who are at high risk of recurrence and might benefit from additional treatment. We conducted a multi-institutional, collaborative case-control study to identify nuclear morphometric features that would be useful for identifying women with DCIS at the highest risk of recurrence. Tissue sections of archival breast tissue of 29 women with recurrent and 73 matched women with nonrecurrent DCIS were stained for DNA, and nuclei in the DCIS lesions were evaluated by image analysis. A clear correlation between mean fractal2_area (FA2) and nuclear grade was observed (P < 0.001), allowing an objective determination of nuclear grade. Several nuclear morphometric features, including mean and variance of variation of radius, mean area, mean and variance of frequency of high boundary harmonics (FQH), and variance in sphericity, were found to be useful in discriminating recurrent from nonrecurrent DCIS subjects. However, the nuclear features associated with recurrence differed between high- and low-grade lesions. For lesions with high FA2 (nuclear grade 3), mean variation of radius, mean FQH, and mean area alone yielded recurrence odds ratios of 4.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-45.96], 3.86 (95% CI, 0.88-16.98), 2.90 (95% CI, 0.31-27.2), respectively. Using a summed feature model, high-FA2 lesions showing three poor prognostic features had an odds ratio of 15.63 (95% CI, 1.22-200), compared with those with zero or one poor prognostic feature. Lesions with low mean FA2 (nuclear grade 1 or 2) showing high variances in sphericity and FQH had an odds ratio of 7.71 (95% CI, 1.77-33.60). Addition of other features did not enhance the odds ratio or its significance. These results suggest that nuclear image analysis of DCIS lesions may provide an adjunctive tool to conventional pathological analysis, both for the objective assessment of nuclear grade and for the identification of features that predict patient outcome.",other,[]

Diagnosis of this complication of DM is time-consuming and not routinely performed in the clinical practice, in contrast to fundus retinal imaging which is accessible and routinely performed. Whether artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing retinal images collected through diabetic eye screening can provide an efficient diagnostic method for CAN is unknown.
METHODS: This was a single center, observational study in a cohort of patients with DM as a part of the Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Diabetes: The Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project (NCT05626413). To diagnose CAN, we used standard CV autonomic reflex tests. In this analysis we implemented AI-based deep learning techniques with non-mydriatic 5-field color fundus imaging to identify patients with CAN. Two experiments have been developed utilizing Multiple Instance Learning and primarily ResNet 18 as the backbone network. Models underwent training and validation prior to testing on an unseen image set.
RESULTS: In an analysis of 2275 retinal images from 229 patients, the ResNet 18 backbone model demonstrated robust diagnostic capabilities in the binary classification of CAN, correctly identifying 93% of CAN cases and 89% of non-CAN cases within the test set. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) of 0.87 (95% CI 0.74-0.97). For distinguishing between definite or severe stages of CAN (dsCAN), the ResNet 18 model accurately classified 78% of dsCAN cases and 93% of cases without dsCAN, with an AUCROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.86-1.00). An alternate backbone model, ResWide 50, showed enhanced sensitivity at 89% for dsCAN, but with a marginally lower AUCROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.73-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: AI-based algorithms utilising retinal images can differentiate with high accuracy patients with CAN. AI analysis of fundus images to detect CAN may be implemented in routine clinical practice to identify patients at the highest CV risk.

Deficits in CEP composition measured using T2* biomarkers from UTE MRI are associated with more severe intervertebral disc degeneration in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP). The goal of this study was to develop an objective, accurate, and efficient deep-learning-based method for calculating biomarkers of CEP health using UTE images.
METHODS: Multi-echo UTE MRI of the lumbar spine was acquired from a prospectively enrolled cross-sectional and consecutive cohort of 83 subjects spanning a wide range of ages and cLBP-related conditions. CEPs from the L4-S1 levels were manually segmented on 6,972 UTE images and used to train neural networks utilizing the u-net architecture. CEP segmentations and mean CEP T2* values derived from manually- and model-generated segmentations were compared using Dice scores, sensitivity, specificity, Bland-Altman, and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios were calculated and related to model performance.
RESULTS: Compared with manual CEP segmentations, model-generated segmentations achieved sensitives of 0.80-0.91, specificities of 0.99, Dice scores of 0.77-0.85, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values of 0.99, and precision-recall (PR) AUC values of 0.56-0.77, depending on spinal level and sagittal image position. Mean CEP T2* values and principal CEP angles derived from the model-predicted segmentations had low bias in an unseen test dataset (T2* bias =0.33Â±2.37 ms, angle bias =0.36Â±2.65Â°). To simulate a hypothetical clinical scenario, the predicted segmentations were used to stratify CEPs into high, medium, and low T2* groups. Group predictions had diagnostic sensitivities of 0.77-0.86 and specificities of 0.86-0.95. Model performance was positively associated with image SNR and CNR.
CONCLUSIONS: The trained deep learning models enable accurate, automated CEP segmentations and T2* biomarker computations that are statistically similar to those from manual segmentations. These models address limitations with inefficiency and subjectivity associated with manual methods. Such techniques could be used to elucidate the role of CEP composition in disc degeneration etiology and guide emerging therapies for cLBP.",other,"['deep learning', 'neural network']"

The addition of deep learning methods to lateral spine radiography (a simple, widely available, low-cost test) can potentially solve this problem. In this study, we develop deep learning scores to detect osteoporosis and VF based on lateral spine radiography and investigate whether their use can improve referral of high-risk individuals to bone-density testing. The derivation cohort consisted of patients aged 50âyears or older who underwent lateral spine radiography in Severance Hospital, Korea, from January 2007 to December 2018, providing a total of 26,299 lateral spine plain X-rays for 9276 patients (VF prevalence, 18.6%; osteoporosis prevalence, 40.3%). Two individual deep convolutional neural network scores to detect prevalent VF (VERTE-X pVF score) and osteoporosis (VERTE-X osteo score) were tested on an internal test set (20% hold-out set) and external test set (another hospital cohort [Yongin], 395 patients). VERTE-X pVF, osteo scores, and clinical models to detect prevalent VF or osteoporosis were compared in terms of the areas under the receiver-operating-characteristics curves (AUROCs). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) was calculated when using deep-learning scores to supplement clinical indications for classification of high-risk individuals to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) testing. VERTE-X pVF and osteo scores outperformed clinical models in both the internal (AUROC: VF, 0.93 versus 0.78; osteoporosis, 0.85 versus 0.79) and external (VF, 0.92 versus 0.79; osteoporosis, 0.83 versus 0.65; pâ<â0.01 for all) test sets.

Medical encounter notes can enrich structured EHR data with documented signs and symptoms of OUD and social risks and behaviors. To capture this information at scale, natural language processing (NLP) tools must be developed and evaluated. We developed and applied an annotation schema to deeply characterize OUD and related clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors, and automated the annotation schema using machine learning and deep learning-based approaches.
METHODS: Using the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database, we queried hospital discharge summaries of patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) OUD diagnostic codes. We developed an annotation schema to characterize problematic opioid use, identify individuals with potential OUD, and provide psychosocial context. Two annotators reviewed discharge summaries from 100 patients. We randomly sampled patients with their associated annotated sentences and divided them into training (66 patients; 2,127 annotated sentences) and testing (29 patients; 1,149 annotated sentences) sets. We used the training set to generate features, employing three NLP algorithms/knowledge sources. We trained and tested prediction models for classification with a traditional machine learner (logistic regression) and deep learning approach (Autogluon based on ELECTRA's replaced token detection model). We applied a five-fold cross-validation approach to reduce bias in performance estimates.
RESULTS: The resulting annotation schema contained 32 classes. We achieved moderate inter-annotator agreement, with F<sub>1</sub>-scores across all classes increasing from 48 to 66%. Five classes had a sufficient number of annotations for automation; of these, we observed consistently high performance (F<sub>1</sub>-scores) across training and testing sets for drug screening (training: 91-96; testing: 91-94) and opioid type (training: 86-96; testing: 86-99). Performance dropped from training and to testing sets for other drug use (training: 52-65; testing: 40-48), pain management (training: 72-78; testing: 61-78) and psychiatric (training: 73-80; testing: 72). Autogluon achieved the highest performance.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated that rich information regarding problematic opioid use can be manually identified by annotators. However, more training samples and features would improve our ability to reliably identify less common classes from clinical text, including text from outpatient settings.",other,"['deep learning', 'language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

DESIGN: An interpretable, weakly supervised deep learning framework incorporating prior knowledge was proposed to analyse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore new prognostic phenotypes on pathological whole-slide images (WSIs) from the Zhongshan cohort of 1125 HCC patients (2451 WSIs) and TCGA cohort of 320 HCC patients (320 WSIs). A 'tumour risk score (TRS)' was established to evaluate patient outcomes, and then risk activation mapping (RAM) was applied to visualise the pathological phenotypes of TRS. The multi-omics data of The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) HCC were used to assess the potential pathogenesis underlying TRS.
RESULTS: Survival analysis revealed that TRS was an independent prognosticator in both the Zhongshan cohort (p&lt;0.0001) and TCGA cohort (p=0.0003). The predictive ability of TRS was superior to and independent of clinical staging systems, and TRS could evenly stratify patients into up to five groups with significantly different prognoses. Notably, sinusoidal capillarisation, prominent nucleoli and karyotheca, the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and infiltrating inflammatory cells were identified as the main underlying features of TRS. The multi-omics data of TCGA HCC hint at the relevance of TRS to tumour immune infiltration and genetic alterations such as the FAT3 and RYR2 mutations.
CONCLUSION: Our deep learning framework is an effective and labour-saving method for decoding pathological images, providing a valuable means for HCC risk stratification and precise patient treatment.",other,"['deep learning', 'visual']"

Even after a fracture occurs, high fracture risk remains widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Common fracture risk assessment tools utilize a subset of clinical risk factors for prediction, and often require manual data entry. Furthermore, these tools predict risk over the long term and do not explicitly provide short-term risk estimates necessary to identify patients likely to experience a fracture in the next 1-2 years.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an algorithm for the identification of patients at risk of fracture in a subsequent 1- to 2-year period. In order to address the aforementioned limitations of current prediction tools, this approach focused on a short-term timeframe, automated data entry, and the use of longitudinal data to inform the predictions.
METHODS: Using retrospective electronic health record data from over 1,000,000 patients, we developed Crystal Bone, an algorithm that applies machine learning techniques from natural language processing to the temporal nature of patient histories to generate short-term fracture risk predictions. Similar to how language models predict the next word in a given sentence or the topic of a document, Crystal Bone predicts whether a patient's future trajectory might contain a fracture event, or whether the signature of the patient's journey is similar to that of a typical future fracture patient. A holdout set with 192,590 patients was used to validate accuracy. Experimental baseline models and human-level performance were used for comparison.
RESULTS: The model accurately predicted 1- to 2-year fracture risk for patients aged over 50 years (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUROC] 0.81). These algorithms outperformed the experimental baselines (AUROC 0.67) and showed meaningful improvements when compared to retrospective approximation of human-level performance by correctly identifying 9649 of 13,765 (70%) at-risk patients who did not receive any preventative bone-health-related medical interventions from their physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that it is possible to use a patient's unique medical history as it changes over time to predict the risk of short-term fracture. Validating and applying such a tool within the health care system could enable automated and widespread prediction of this risk and may help with identification of patients at very high risk of fracture.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

METHODS: T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time maps were analyzed for 4,384 subjects from the baseline Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) Dataset. Voxel Based Relaxometry (VBR) was used for automatic quantification and voxel-based analysis of the differences in T<sub>2</sub> between subjects with and without radiographic OA. A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet) was trained to diagnose OA from T<sub>2</sub> data. For comparison, more classical feature extraction techniques and shallow classifiers were used to benchmark the performance of our algorithm's results. Deep and shallow models were evaluated with and without the inclusion of risk factors. Sensitivity and Specificity values and McNemar test were used to compare the performance of the different classifiers.
RESULTS: The best shallow model was obtained when the first ten Principal Components, demographics and pain score were included as features (AUCÂ =Â 77.77%, SensitivityÂ =Â 67.01%, SpecificityÂ =Â 71.79%). In comparison, DenseNet trained on raw T<sub>2</sub> data obtained AUCÂ =Â 83.44%, SensitivityÂ =Â 76.99%, SpecificityÂ =Â 77.94%.

CONCLUSION: In this study, we presented a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based data-driven platform using T<sub>2</sub> measurements to characterize radiographic OA. Our results showed that feature learning from T<sub>2</sub> maps has potential in uncovering information that can potentially better diagnose OA than simple averages or linear patterns decomposition.",other,['deep learning']

Automated quantification of EPVS would greatly help to advance research into its etiology and its potential as a risk indicator of disease. We propose a convolutional network regression method to quantify the extent of EPVS in the basal ganglia from 3D brain MRI. We first segment the basal ganglia and subsequently apply a 3D convolutional regression network designed for small object detection within this region of interest. The network takes an image as input, and outputs a quantification score of EPVS. The network has significantly more convolution operations than pooling ones and no final activation, allowing it to span the space of real numbers. We validated our approach using a dataset of 2000 brain MRI scans scored visually. Experiments with varying sizes of training and test sets showed that a good performance can be achieved with a training set of only 200 scans. With a training set of 1000 scans, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between our scoring method and the expert's visual score was 0.74. Our method outperforms by a large margin - more than 0.10 - four more conventional automated approaches based on intensities, scale-invariant feature transform, and random forest. We show that the network learns the structures of interest and investigate the influence of hyper-parameters on the performance. We also evaluate the reproducibility of our network using a set of 60 subjects scanned twice (scan-rescan reproducibility). On this set our network achieves an ICC of 0.93, while the intrarater agreement reaches 0.80. Furthermore, the automated EPVS scoring correlates similarly to age as visual scoring.",other,"['visual', 'neural network']"

Online ahead of print.,Far A,Hepatology,2024,2024/10/08,,,10.1097/HEP.0000000000001115,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis code classification is a common method for cohort identification in cirrhosis research, but it is often inaccurate and augmented by labor-intensive chart review. Natural language processing (NLP) using large language models (LLMs) is a potentially more accurate method. To assess LLMs' potential for cirrhosis cohort identification, we compared code-based versus LLM-based classification with chart review as a ""gold standard.""
METHODS: We extracted and conducted a limited chart review of 3,788 discharge summaries of cirrhosis admissions. We engineered zero-shot prompts using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4 to determine whether cirrhosis and its complications were active hospitalization problems. We calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) of LLM-based classification versus limited chart review, and PPVs of code-based versus LLM-based classification as a ""silver standard"" in all 3,788 summaries.
RESULTS: Versus gold standard chart review, code-based classification achieved PPVs of 82.2% for identifying cirrhosis, 41.7% hepatic encephalopathy, 72.8% ascites, 59.8% gastrointestinal bleeding, and 48.8% spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Compared to chart review, GPT-4 achieved 87.8-98.8% accuracies for identifying cirrhosis and its complications. Using LLM as a silver standard, code-based classification achieved PPVs of 79.8% for identifying cirrhosis, 53.9% hepatic encephalopathy, 55.3% ascites, 67.6% gastrointestinal bleeding, and 65.5% spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
CONCLUSIONS: LLM-based classification was highly accurate versus manual chart review in identifying cirrhosis and its complications - this allowed us to assess the performance of code-based classification at scale using LLMs as a silver standard. These results suggest LLMs could augment or replace code-based cohort classification and raise questions regarding the necessity of chart review.",other,"['language processing', 'language processing']"

Commercially available LLMs, however, are not optimized for clinical uses and are prone to generating hallucinatory information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an enterprise architecture that allows the embedding of customized data into LLMs. This approach ""specializes"" the LLMs and is thought to reduce hallucinations.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We developed ""LiVersa,"" a liver disease-specific LLM, by using our institution's protected health information-complaint text embedding and LLM platform, ""Versa."" We conducted RAG on 30 publicly available American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidance documents to be incorporated into LiVersa. We evaluated LiVersa's performance by conducting 2 rounds of testing. First, we compared LiVersa's outputs versus those of trainees from a previously published knowledge assessment. LiVersa answered all 10 questions correctly. Second, we asked 15 hepatologists to evaluate the outputs of 10 hepatology topic questions generated by LiVersa, OpenAI's ChatGPT 4, and Meta's Large Language Model Meta AI 2. LiVersa's outputs were more accurate but were rated less comprehensive and safe compared to those of ChatGPT 4.

The level of ACE2 in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies collected in previous studies from 170Â men (age: 19-65Â years, weight: 56-137Â kg, BMI: 23-44) and 69 women (age: 18-55Â years, weight: 41-126Â kg, BMI: 22-39) was analyzed in duplicate by western blot. VO<sub>2</sub> max was determined by ergospirometry and body composition by DXA. ACE2 protein expression was 1.8-fold higher in women than men (pÂ =Â 0.001, nÂ =Â 239). This sex difference disappeared after accounting for the percentage of body fat (fat %), VO<sub>2</sub> max per kg of legs lean mass (VO<sub>2</sub> max-LLM) and age (pÂ =Â 0.47). Multiple regression analysis showed that the fat % (Î²Â =Â 0.47) is the main predictor of the variability in ACE2 protein expression in skeletal muscle, explaining 5.2% of the variance. VO<sub>2</sub> max-LLM had also predictive value (Î²Â =Â 0.09). There was a significant fat % by VO<sub>2</sub> max-LLM interaction, such that for subjects with low fat %, VO<sub>2</sub> max-LLM was positively associated with ACE2 expression while as fat % increased the slope of the positive association between VO<sub>2</sub> max-LLM and ACE2 was reduced. In conclusion, women express higher amounts of ACE2 in their skeletal muscles than men. This sexual dimorphism is mainly explained by sex differences in fat % and cardiorespiratory fitness.

Using medical record review to identify conditions within large quantities of EMRs can be time-consuming and inefficient. EMR-based phenotyping using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms is a continually developing area of study that holds potential for numerous mental health disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the current state of EMR-based case identification for depression and provides guidance on using current algorithms and constructing new ones.
METHODS: A scoping review of EMR-based algorithms for phenotyping depression was completed. This research encompassed studies published from January 2000 to May 2023. The search involved 3 databases: Embase, MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo. This was carried out using selected keywords that fell into 3 categories: terms connected with EMRs, terms connected to case identification, and terms pertaining to depression. This study adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 20 papers were assessed and summarized in the review. Most of these studies were undertaken in the United States, accounting for 75% (15/20). The United Kingdom and Spain followed this, accounting for 15% (3/20) and 10% (2/20) of the studies, respectively. Both data-driven and clinical rule-based methodologies were identified. The development of EMR-based phenotypes and algorithms indicates the data accessibility permitted by each health system, which led to varying performance levels among different algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: Better use of structured and unstructured EMR components through techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing has the potential to improve depression phenotyping. However, more validation must be carried out to have confidence in depression case identification algorithms in general.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

South Asia, in particular, has seen limited development in this area of research, and applying existing models from other regions is challenging due to cost constraints and the region's distinct linguistics and behavior. Social media analysis, notably on platforms such as Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc), offers the potential for detecting major depressive disorder and aiding individuals at risk of suicidal ideation.
OBJECTIVE: This study primarily focuses on India and Bangladesh, both South Asian countries. It aims to construct a predictive model for suicidal ideation by incorporating unique, unexplored features along with masked content from both public and private Facebook profiles. Moreover, the research aims to fill the existing research gap by addressing the distinct challenges posed by South Asia's unique behavioral patterns, socioeconomic conditions, and linguistic nuances. Ultimately, this research strives to enhance suicide prevention efforts in the region by offering a cost-effective solution.
METHODS: This quantitative research study will gather data through a web-based platform. Initially, participants will be asked a few demographic questions and to complete the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire assessment. Eligible participants who provide consent will receive an email requesting them to upload a ZIP file of their Facebook data. The study will begin by determining whether Facebook is the primary application for the participants based on their active hours and Facebook use duration. Subsequently, the predictive model will incorporate a wide range of previously unexplored variables, including anonymous postings, and textual analysis features, such as captions, biographic information, group membership, preferred pages, interactions with advertisement content, and search history. The model will also analyze the use of emojis and the types of games participants engage with on Facebook.
RESULTS: The study obtained approval from the scientific review committee on October 2, 2023, and subsequently received institutional review committee ethical clearance on December 8, 2023. Our system is anticipated to automatically detect posts related to depression by analyzing the text and use pattern of the individual with the best accuracy possible. Ultimately, our research aims to have practical utility in identifying individuals who may be at risk of depression or in need of mental health support.
CONCLUSIONS: This initiative aims to enhance engagement in suicidal ideation medical care in South Asia to improve health outcomes. It is set to be the first study to consider predicting participants' primary social application use before analyzing their content to forecast behavior and mental states. The study holds the potential to revolutionize strategies and offer insights for scalable, accessible interventions while maintaining quality through comprehensive Facebook feature analysis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the incidence of AF in patients admitted for ACS and to evaluate its association with adverse outcomes, given the recent advances in management of both diseases.
METHODS: Natural language processing search algorithms identified AF in patients admitted with ACS across 13 Northwell Health Hospitals from 2015 to 2021. Hierarchical generalized linear mixed modeling was used to assess the association between AF and in-hospital mortality, bleeding, and stroke outcomes; marginal Cox regression modeling was used to assess the association between AF and postdischarge mortality.
RESULTS: Of 12,315 patients admitted for ACS, 3018 (24.5%) had AF with 1609 (53.3%) newly diagnosed. AF patients more commonly received anticoagulation with an oral anticoagulant (80.4% vs 12.3%) or heparin (61.9% vs 56.9%), had lengthier intensive care unit stay (72 vs 49 hours), and underwent fewer percutaneous coronary interventions (31.9% vs 53.1%). In-hospital bleeding, stroke, and mortality were higher in the AF group (15.3% vs 5.0%, 7.4% vs 2.4%, and 6.9% vs 2.1%, respectively).

Innovation in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) has made automatic analysis of large-scale text data accessible to study individual perspectives in a convenient and efficient fashion. Here we blend citizen science with innovation in NLP and ML to examine (1) which categories of life events persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) perceived as central for their MS; and (2) associated emotions. We subsequently relate our results to standardized individual-level measures. Participants (n = 1039) took part in the 'My Life with MS' study of the Swiss MS Registry which involved telling their story through self-selected life events using text descriptions and a semi-structured questionnaire. We performed topic modeling ('latent Dirichlet allocation') to identify high-level topics underlying the text descriptions. Using a pre-trained language model, we performed a fine-grained emotion analysis of the text descriptions. A topic modeling analysis of totally 4293 descriptions revealed eight underlying topics. Five topics are common in clinical research: 'diagnosis', 'medication/treatment', 'relapse/child', 'rehabilitation/wheelchair', and 'injection/symptoms'. However, three topics, 'work', 'birth/health', and 'partnership/MS' represent domains that are of great relevance for participants but are generally understudied in MS research. While emotions were predominantly negative (sadness, anxiety), emotions linked to the topics 'birth/health' and 'partnership/MS' was also positive (joy). Designed in close collaboration with persons with MS, the 'My Life with MS' project explores the experience of living with the chronic disease of MS using NLP and ML. Our study thus contributes to the body of research demonstrating the potential of integrating citizen science with ML-driven NLP methods to explore the experience of living with a chronic condition.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Project, which was developed in Brazil between November 2018 and March 2019. We investigated the influence of sentiment aspects of news to explore their possible relationships with syphilis testing data in response to the syphilis epidemic in Brazil. A dictionary-based technique (VADER) was chosen to perform sentiment analysis considering the Brazilian Portuguese language. Finally, the data collected were used in statistical tests to obtain other indicators, such as correlation and distribution analysis. Of the 627 news items, 198 (31.58%) were classified as a sentiment of security (TP2; stands for the news type 2), whereas 429 (68.42%) were classified as sentiments that instilled vulnerability (TP3; stands for the news type 3). The correlation between the number of syphilis tests and the number of news types TP2 and TP3 was verified from (i) 2015 to 2017 and (ii) 2018 to 2019. For the TP2 type news, in all periods, the p-values were greater than 0.05, thus generating inconclusive results. From 2015 to 2017, there was an Ï = 0.33 correlation between TP3 news and testing data (p-value = 0.04); the years 2018 and 2019 presented a Ï = 0.67 correlation between TP3 news and the number of syphilis tests performed per month, with p-value = 0.0003. In addition, Granger's test was performed between TP3 news and syphilis testing, which resulted in a p-value = 0.002, thus indicating the existence of Granger causality between these time series. By applying natural language processing to sentiment and informational content analysis of public health campaigns, it was found that the most substantial increase in testing was strongly related to attitude-inducing content (TP3).",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

In addition to undermining maternal welfare, untreated postpartum psychopathology can result in child emotional and physical neglect and associated significant pediatric health costs. Some women may experience traumatic childbirth and develop posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after delivery (childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder). Although women are routinely screened for postpartum depression in the United States, there is no recommended protocol to inform the identification of women who are likely to experience childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Advancements in computational methods of free text have shown promise in informing the diagnosis of psychiatric conditions. Although the language in narratives of stressful events has been associated with posttrauma outcomes, whether the narratives of childbirth processed via machine learning can be useful for childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder screening is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the use of written narrative accounts of personal childbirth experiences for the identification of women with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. To this end, we developed a model based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder via the classification of birth narratives.
STUDY DESIGN: Overall, 1127 eligible postpartum women who enrolled in a study survey during the COVID-19 pandemic provided short written childbirth narrative accounts in which they were instructed to focus on the most distressing aspects of their childbirth experience. They also completed a posttraumatic stress disorder symptom screen to determine childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. After the exclusion criteria were applied, data from 995 participants were analyzed. A machine learning-based Sentence-Transformers natural language processing model was used to represent narratives as vectors that served as inputs for a neural network machine learning model developed in this study to identify participants with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder.
RESULTS: The machine learning model derived from natural language processing of childbirth narratives achieved good performance (area under the curve, 0.75; F1 score, 0.76; sensitivity, 0.8; specificity, 0.70). Moreover, women with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder generated longer narratives (t test results: t=2.30; p=.02) and used more negative emotional expressions (Wilcoxon test: sadness: p=8.90e-04; W=31,017; anger: p=1.32e-02; W=35,005.50) and death-related words (Wilcoxon test: p=3.48e-05; W=34,538) in describing their childbirth experience than those with no childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder.
CONCLUSION: This study provided proof of concept that personal childbirth narrative accounts generated in the early postpartum period and analyzed via advanced computational methods can detect with relatively high accuracy women who are likely to endorse childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder and those at low risk. This suggests that birth narratives could be promising for informing low-cost, noninvasive tools for maternal mental health screening, and more research that used machine learning to predict early signs of maternal psychiatric morbidity is warranted.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'neural network', 'natural language processing']"

To mitigate the impacts of the CS epidemic, the Brazilian government has developed a national intervention project called ""Syphilis No."" Thus, among its range of actions is the production of thousands of writings featuring the experiences of research and intervention supporters (RIS) of the project, called field researchers. In addition, this large volume of base data was subjected to analysis through data mining, which may contribute to better strategies for combating syphilis. Natural language processing is a form of knowledge extraction. First, the database extracted from the ""LUES Platform"" with 4,874 documents between 2018 and 2020 was employed. This was followed by text preprocessing, selecting texts referring to the field researchers' reports for analysis. Finally, for analyzing the documents, N-grams extraction (N = 2,3,4) was performed. The combination of the TF-IDF metric with the BoW algorithm was applied to assess terms' importance and frequency and text clustering. In total, 1019 field activity reports were mined. Word extraction from the text mining method set out the following guiding axioms from the bigrams: ""confronting syphilis in primary health care;"" ""investigation committee for congenital syphilis in the territory;"" ""municipal plan for monitoring and investigating syphilis cases through health surveillance;"" ""women's healthcare networks for syphilis in pregnant;"" ""diagnosis and treatment with a focus on rapid testing."" Text mining may serve public health research subjects when used in parallel with the conventional content analysis method. The computational method extracted intervention activities from field researchers, also providing inferences on how the strategies of the ""Syphilis No"" Project influenced the decrease in congenital syphilis cases in the territory.",other,"['language processing', 'text mining', 'language processing']"

Epub 2021 Nov 9.,Gordon AJ,Am J Emerg Med,2022,2021/11/28,,,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.11.001,"BACKGROUND: The Mortality Probability Model (MPM) is used in research and quality improvement to adjust for severity of illness and can also inform triage decisions. However, a limitation for its automated use or application is that it includes the variable ""intracranial mass effect"" (IME), which requires human engagement with the electronic health record (EHR). We developed and tested a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify IME from CT head reports.
METHODS: We obtained initial CT head reports from adult patients who were admitted to the ICU from our ED between 10/2013 and 9/2016. Each head CT head report was labeled yes/no IME by at least two of five independent labelers. The reports were then randomly divided 80/20 into training and test sets. All reports were preprocessed to remove linguistic and style variability, and a dictionary was created to map similar common terms. We tested three vectorization strategies: Term Frequency-Inverse Document frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Universal Sentence Encoder to convert the report text to a numerical vector. This vector served as the input to a classification-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm (XGBoost). After training, model performance was assessed in the test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We also divided the continuous range of scores into positive/inconclusive/negative categories for IME.
RESULTS: Of the 1202 CT reports in the training set, 308 (25.6%) reports were manually labeled as ""yes"" for IME. Of the 355 reports in the test set, 108 (30.4%) were labeled as ""yes"" for IME. The TF-IDF vectorization strategy as an input for the XGBoost model had the best AUROC:-- 0.9625 (95% CI 0.9443-0.9807). TF-IDF score categories were defined and had the following likelihood ratios: ""positive"" (TF-IDF scoreÂ >Â 0.5) LRÂ =Â 24.59; ""inconclusive"" (TF-IDF 0.05-0.5) LRÂ =Â 0.99; and ""negative"" (TF-IDFÂ <Â 0.05) LRÂ =Â 0.05. 82% of reports were classified as either ""positive"" or ""negative"". In the test set, only 4 of 199 (2.0%) reports with a ""negative"" classification were false negatives and only 8 of 93 (8.6%) reports classified as ""positive"" were false positives.
CONCLUSION: NLP can accurately identify IME from free-text reports of head CTs in approximately 80% of records, adequate to allow automatic calculation of MPM based on EHR data for many applications.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing', 'ensemble']"

Given the increasing volume of research articles generated, the retrieval and synthesis of evidence are increasingly becoming laborious and time-consuming. Information technology could help to reduce workload for humans. To guide supervised learning however, human identification of key study characteristics is necessary. Reporting guidelines recommend that authors include essential content in articles and could generate manually labeled training data for automated evidence retrieval and synthesis. Here, we present a semiautomated approach to annotate, link, and track the content of nutrition research manuscripts. We used the STROBE extension for nutritional epidemiology (STROBE-nut) reporting guidelines to manually annotate a sample of 15 articles and converted the semantic information into linked data in a Neo4j graph database through an automated process. Six summary statistics were computed to estimate the reporting completeness of the articles. The content structure, presence of essential study characteristics as well as the reporting completeness of the articles are visualized automatically from the graph database. The archived linked data are interoperable through their annotations and relations.

Further evaluation of free-text reports is difficult to achieve without a great deal of manual effort, and is not possible in everyday clinical practice. This study aims to automatically capture clinical information and positive hit rates from narrative radiological reports of suspected urolithiasis using natural language processing (NLP).
METHODS: Narrative reports of low dose computed tomography (CT) of the retroperitoneum from April 2016 to July 2018 (n = 1714) were analyzed using NLP. These free-text reports were automatically structured based on RadLex concepts. Manual feedback was used to test and train the NLP engine to further enhance the performance. The chi-squared test, phi coefficient, and logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the effect of clinical information on the positive hit rate of urolithiasis.
RESULTS: Urolithiasis was affirmed in 72 % of the reports; in 38 % at least one stone was described in the kidneys, and in 45 % at least one stone was described in the ureter. Clinical information, such as previous stone history and obstructive uropathy, showed a strong correlation with confirmed urolithiasis (p = 0.001). Previous stone history and the combination of obstructive uropathy and loin pain had the highest association with positive urolithiasis (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Applying this NLP approach to already existing free-text reports allows the conversion of such reports into a structured form. This may be valuable for epidemiological studies, to evaluate the appropriateness of CT examinations, or to answer a variety of research questions.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Report No.: 19(20)-EHC026-EF.,Gartlehner G,Assessing the Accuracy of Machine-Assisted Abstract Screening With DistillerAI: A User Study,2019,2019/11/01,,,,"BACKGROUND: Web applications that employ natural language processing technologies such as text mining and text classification to support systematic reviewers during abstract screening have become more user friendly and more common. Such semi-automated screening tools can increase efficiency by reducing the number of abstracts needed to screen or by replacing one screener after adequately training the algorithm of the machine. Savings in workload between 30 percent and 70 percent might be possible with the use of such tools. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool.
METHODS: To address our objective, we evaluated the accuracy of a machine-assisted screening approach using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review as the reference standard. We chose DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool for our project, applying its naÃ¯ve Bayesian machine-learning option. Five teams screened the same 2,472 abstracts in parallel, using the machine-assisted approach. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For the remaining 2,172 abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener in each team and provided predictions about the relevance of records. We used a prediction score of 0.5 (i.e., inconclusive) or greater to classify a record as an inclusion. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening (i.e., no machine assistance), and screening with DistillerAI alone (i.e., no human involvement after training) against the reference standard and calculated sensitivities, specificities, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. In addition, we determined the interrater agreement, the proportion of included abstracts, and the number of conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI.
RESULTS: The mean sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 66% to 90%), and the mean specificity was 95 percent (95% CI, 92% to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was also 78 percent (95% CI, 66% to 89%); the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was 14 percent (95% CI, 0% to 31%). Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI alone were 94 percent (95% CI, 91% to 97%) and 98 percent (95% CI, 97% to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86).
DISCUSSION: Findings of our study indicate that the accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening. The approach that we tested missed too many relevant studies and created too many conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews.",other,"['dl', 'language processing', 'natural language processing', 'text mining', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Recent federal initiatives promote the use of RWD to make clinical assertions that influence regulatory decision-making. Our objective was to determine whether traditional real world evidence (RWE) techniques in cardiovascular medicine achieve accuracy sufficient for credible clinical assertions, also known as ""regulatory-grade"" RWE.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic health records (EHR), 2010-2016.
METHODS: A predefined set of clinical concepts was extracted from EHR structured (EHR-S) and unstructured (EHR-U) data using traditional query techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, respectively. Performance was evaluated against manually annotated cohorts using standard metrics. Accuracy was compared to pre-defined criteria for regulatory-grade. Differences in accuracy were compared using Chi-square test.
RESULTS: The dataset included 10 840 clinical notes. Individual concept occurrence ranged from 194 for coronary artery bypass graft to 4502 for diabetes mellitus. In EHR-S, average recall and precision were 51.7% and 98.3%, respectively and 95.5% and 95.3% in EHR-U, respectively. For each clinical concept, EHR-S accuracy was below regulatory-grade, while EHR-U met or exceeded criteria, with the exception of medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying an appropriate RWE approach is dependent on cohorts studied and accuracy required. In this study, recall varied greatly between EHR-S and EHR-U. Overall, EHR-S did not meet regulatory grade criteria, while EHR-U did. These results suggest that recall should be routinely measured in EHR-based studes intended for regulatory use. Furthermore, advanced data and technologies may be required to achieve regulatory grade results.",other,[]

This corpus consists of three main components: sentence classification, entity identification, and entity normalization. We split the review posts into sentences and labeled them for presence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (2168 sentences), withdrawal symptoms (WDs) (438 sentences), sign/symptoms/illness (SSIs) (789 sentences), drug indications (517), drug effectiveness (EF) (1087 sentences), and drug infectiveness (INF) (337 sentences). In the entity identification phase, we identified and extracted ADRs (4813 mentions), WDs (590 mentions), SSIs (1219 mentions), and DIs (792). In the entity normalization phase, we mapped the identified entities to the corresponding concepts in both UMLS (918 unique concepts) and SNOMED CT (755 unique concepts). Four annotators double coded the sentences and the span of identified entities by strictly following guidelines rules developed for this study. We used the PsyTAR sentence classification component to automatically train a range of supervised machine learning classifiers to identifying text segments with the mentions of ADRs, WDs, DIs, SSIs, EF, and INF. SVMs classifiers had the highest performance with F-Score 0.90. We also measured performance of the cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) in identifying patients' expressions of ADRs and WDs with and without adding PsyTAR dictionary to the core dictionary of cTAKES. Augmenting cTAKES dictionary with PsyTAR improved the F-score cTAKES by 25%. The findings imply that PsyTAR has significant implications for text mining algorithms aimed to identify information about adverse drug events and drug effectiveness from patients' narratives data, by linking the patients' expressions of adverse drug events to medical standard vocabularies. The corpus is publicly available at Zolnoori et al. [30].",other,['text mining']

To electronically harness these records, they need to be transformed into codified fields by natural language processing algorithms.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop, train, and validate Clinical History Extractor for Syndromic Surveillance (CHESS), an natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical information from free-text primary care records.
METHODS: CHESS is a keyword-based natural language processing algorithm to extract 48 signs and symptoms suggesting respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, constitutional, as well as other signs and symptoms potentially associated with infectious diseases. The algorithm also captured the assertion status (affirmed, negated, or suspected) and symptom duration. Electronic medical records from the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics, a major public sector primary care provider in Singapore, were randomly extracted and manually reviewed by 2 human reviewers, with a third reviewer as the adjudicator. The algorithm was evaluated based on 1680 notes against the human-coded result as the reference standard, with half of the data used for training and the other half for validation.
RESULTS: The symptoms most commonly present within the 1680 clinical records at the episode level were those typically present in respiratory infections such as cough (744/7703, 9.66%), sore throat (591/7703, 7.67%), rhinorrhea (552/7703, 7.17%), and fever (928/7703, 12.04%). At the episode level, CHESS had an overall performance of 96.7% precision and 97.6% recall on the training dataset and 96.0% precision and 93.1% recall on the validation dataset. Symptoms suggesting respiratory and gastrointestinal infections were all detected with more than 90% precision and recall. CHESS correctly assigned the assertion status in 97.3%, 97.9%, and 89.8% of affirmed, negated, and suspected signs and symptoms, respectively (97.6% overall accuracy). Symptom episode duration was correctly identified in 81.2% of records with known duration status.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an natural language processing algorithm dubbed CHESS that achieves good performance in extracting signs and symptoms from primary care free-text clinical records. In addition to the presence of symptoms, our algorithm can also accurately distinguish affirmed, negated, and suspected assertion statuses and extract symptom durations.",other,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Although the highest quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, hemochromatosis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database (UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets (disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships.",other,"['dl', 'text mining']"

However, models need to be evaluated for unequal performance across racial groups (ie, racial bias) so that existing racial disparities are not exacerbated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether racial bias exists in a predictive machine learning model that identifies 180-day cancer mortality risk among patients with solid malignant tumors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, a machine learning model to predict cancer mortality for patients aged 21 years or older diagnosed with cancer between January 2016 and December 2021 was developed with a random forest algorithm using retrospective data from the Mount Sinai Health System cancer registry, Social Security Death Index, and electronic health records up to the date when databases were accessed for cohort extraction (February 2022).
EXPOSURE: Race category.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were model discriminatory performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], F1 score) among each race category (Asian, Black, Native American, White, and other or unknown) and fairness metrics (equal opportunity, equalized odds, and disparate impact) among each pairwise comparison of race categories. True-positive rate ratios represented equal opportunity; both true-positive and false-positive rate ratios, equalized odds; and the percentage of predictive positive rate ratios, disparate impact. All metrics were estimated as a proportion or ratio, with variability captured through 95% CIs. The prespecified criterion for the model's clinical use was a threshold of at least 80% for fairness metrics across different racial groups to ensure the model's prediction would not be biased against any specific race.
RESULTS: The test validation dataset included 43â¯274 patients with balanced demographics. Mean (SD) age was 64.09 (14.26) years, with 49.6% older than 65 years. A total of 53.3% were female; 9.5%, Asian; 18.9%, Black; 0.1%, Native American; 52.2%, White; and 19.2%, other or unknown race; 0.1% had missing race data. A total of 88.9% of patients were alive, and 11.1% were dead. The AUROCs, F1 scores, and fairness metrics maintained reasonable concordance among the racial subgroups: the AUROCs ranged from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72-0.78) for Asian patients and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.77) for Black patients to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.79) for patients with other or unknown race; F1 scores, from 0.32 (95% CI, 0.32-0.33) for White patients to 0.40 (95% CI, 0.39-0.42) for Black patients; equal opportunity ratios, from 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98) for Black patients compared with White patients to 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00-1.04) for Black patients compared with patients with other or unknown race; equalized odds ratios, from 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) for Black patients compared with White patients to 1.16 (1.10-1.21) for Black patients compared with patients with other or unknown race; and disparate impact ratios, from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.89) for Black patients compared with White patients to 1.17 (95% CI, 1.12-1.22) for Black patients compared with patients with other or unknown race.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the lack of significant variation in performance or fairness metrics indicated an absence of racial bias, suggesting that the model fairly identified cancer mortality risk across racial groups. It remains essential to consistently review the model's application in clinical settings to ensure equitable patient care.",other,[]

Linkage between CARTO procedural data and patients' electronical health records (EHR) provides an opportunity to identify the ablation-related parameters that would predict AF recurrence. The objective of this study is to assess the incremental accuracy of RFA procedural data to predict post-ablation AF recurrence using machine learning model. Procedural data generated during RFA procedure were downloaded from CARTONET and linked to deidentified Mercy Health EHR data. Data were divided into train (70%) and test (30%) data for model development and validation. Automate machine learning (AutoML) was used to predict 1 year AF recurrence, defined as a composite of repeat ablation, electrical cardioversion, and AF hospitalization. At first, AutoML model only included Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Second, an AutoML model with procedural variables and demographical/clinical variables was developed. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were used to compare model performances using test data. Among 306 patients, 67 (21.9%) patients experienced 1-year AF recurrence. AUROC increased from 0.66 to 0.78 after adding procedural data in the AutoML model based on test data. For patients with AF recurrence, NRI was 32% for model with procedural data. Nine of 10 important predictive features were CARTO procedural data. From CARTO procedural data, patients with lower contact force in right inferior site, long ablation duration, and low number of left inferior and right roof lesions had a higher risk of AF recurrence. Patients with persistent AF were more likely to have AF recurrence. The machine learning model with procedural data better predicted 1-year AF recurrence than the model without procedural data. The model could be used for identification of patients with high risk of AF recurrence post ablation.",other,[]
38259742,A machine learning model to predict the risk of depression in US adults with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome: a cross-sectional study,"Li E, Ai F, Liang C.",Front Public Health. 2024 Jan 8;11:1348803. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1348803. eCollection 2023.,Li E,Front Public Health,2024,2024/01/23,PMC10800603,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1348803,"OBJECTIVE: Depression is very common and harmful in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). It is necessary to screen OSAHS patients for depression early. However, there are no validated tools to assess the likelihood of depression in patients with OSAHS. This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and machine learning (ML) methods to construct a risk prediction model for depression, aiming to predict the probability of depression in the OSAHS population. Relevant features were analyzed and a nomogram was drawn to visually predict and easily estimate the risk of depression according to the best performing model.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Data from three cycles (2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2015-2016) were selected from the NHANES database, and 16 influencing factors were screened and included. Three prediction models were established by the logistic regression algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and random forest algorithm, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess evaluate and compare the different ML models.
RESULTS: The logistic regression model had lower sensitivity than the lasso model, while the specificity and AUC area were higher than the random forest and lasso models. Moreover, when the threshold probability range was 0.19-0.25 and 0.45-0.82, the net benefit of the logistic regression model was the largest. The logistic regression model clarified the factors contributing to depression, including gender, general health condition, body mass index (BMI), smoking, OSAHS severity, age, education level, ratio of family income to poverty (PIR), and asthma.
CONCLUSION: This study developed three machine learning (ML) models (logistic regression model, lasso model, and random forest model) using the NHANES database to predict depression and identify influencing factors among OSAHS patients. Among them, the logistic regression model was superior to the lasso and random forest models in overall prediction performance. By drawing the nomogram and applying it to the sleep testing center or sleep clinic, sleep technicians and medical staff can quickly and easily identify whether OSAHS patients have depression to carry out the necessary referral and psychological treatment.",other,['visual']

BLM-s (BCL-2-like molecule, small transcript isoform), a BH3-only proapoptotic BCL-2 family member, mediates apoptosis of postmitotic immature neurons during embryonic cortical development, but its role in the adult brain is unknown. To better understand the physiological role of Blm-s gene in vivo, we generated a Blm-s-knockout (Blm-s-/-) mouse. The Blm-s-/- mice breed normally and exhibit grossly normal development. However, global depletion of Blm-s is highly associated with depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in adult mutant mice with intact learning and memory capacity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of adult Blm-s-/- mice reveals reduced connectivity mainly in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) of the hippocampus with no alteration in the dorsal DG connectivity and in total hippocampal volume. At the cellular level, BLM-s is expressed in DG granule cells (GCs), and Blm-s-/- mice show reduced dendritic complexity and decreased spine density in mature GCs. Electrophysiology study uncovers that mature vGCs in adult Blm-s-/- DG are intrinsically more excitable. Interestingly, certain genetic variants of the human Blm homologue gene (VPS50) are significantly associated with depression traits from publicly resourced UK Biobank data. Taken together, BLM-s is required for the hippocampal mood control function. Loss of BLM-s causes abnormality in the electrophysiology and morphology of GCs and a disrupted vDG neural network, which could underlie Blm-s-null-associated anxiety and depression.",other,['neural network']

Epub 2020 Jan 28.,Matta K,Environ Pollut,2020,2020/02/12,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114066,"Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterised by the presence of endometriotic tissue outside of the uterus impacting a significant fraction of women of childbearing age. Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a relationship between risk of endometriosis and exposure to some organochlorine persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, these chemicals are numerous and occur in complex and highly correlated mixtures, and to date, most studies have not accounted for this simultaneous exposure. Linear and logistic regression models are constrained to adjusting for multiple exposures when variables are highly intercorrelated, resulting in unstable coefficients and arbitrary findings. Advanced machine learning models, of emerging use in epidemiology, today appear as a promising option to address these limitations. In this study, different machine learning techniques were compared on a dataset from a case-control study conducted in France to explore associations between mixtures of POPs and deep endometriosis. The battery of models encompassed regularised logistic regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine, adaptive boosting, and partial least-squares discriminant analysis with some additional sparsity constraints. These techniques were applied to identify the biomarkers of internal exposure in adipose tissue most associated with endometriosis and to compare model classification performance. The five tested models revealed a consistent selection of most associated POPs with deep endometriosis, including octachlorodibenzofuran, cis-heptachlor epoxide, polychlorinated biphenyl 77 or trans-nonachlor, among others. The high classification performance of all five models confirmed that machine learning may be a promising complementary approach in modelling highly correlated exposure biomarkers and their associations with health outcomes. Regularised logistic regression provided a good compromise between the interpretability of traditional statistical approaches and the classification capacity of machine learning approaches. Applying a battery of complementary algorithms may be a strategic approach to decipher complex exposome-health associations when the underlying structure is unknown.",other,"['neural network', 'artificial neural network']"

The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) is the instrument most widely used to evaluate QoL in Heart Failure (HF) patients. It is a questionnaire containing 21 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 105. A best cut-off value for MLHFQ scores to identify those patients with good, moderate or poor QoL has not been determined.
OBJECTIVE: To determine a cut-off score for the MLHFQ based on the neural network (NN) approach. These cut-off scores will help discriminate between HF patients having good, moderate or poor QoL.
METHODS: This research was carried out in the context of a longitudinal cohort study of new patients attending specialized HF clinics in six participating centers in Quebec, Canada. Patients completed a questionnaire that included the MLHFQ. In addition to this scale, self-perceived health status and clinical information related to the severity of HF were obtained including: the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 6 minute walk test and survival status. We analyzed the database using NN and conventional statistical tools. The NN is a statistical program that recognizes clusters of MLHFQ and relates similar QoL measures to one another. Among the 531 eligible patients, 447 patients with complete questionnaires were used to build randomly two sets for training (learning set) and for testing (validation set) the NN.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 65 years and 24% were women. The median MLHFQ score was 45 (inter-quartile range: 27 to 64). NN identified 3 distinct clusters of MLHFQ that represent the full spectrum of possible scores on the MLHFQ. We estimated that a score of < 24 on the MLHFQ represents a good QoL, a score between 24 and 45 represents a moderate QoL, and a score > 45 represents a poor QoL. Validation with the different severity measures confirmed these categories. These cut-offs allowed us to reach a good total accuracy (91%). These cutoffs were strongly correlated with survival status (p = 0.004), self-perceived health status (p = 0.0032), NYHA functional class (p<0.0001) and standardized 6 minutes walk test (p = 0.05)
CONCLUSION: The identification of three levels of MLHFQ should be useful in clinical decision making.",other,['neural network']
