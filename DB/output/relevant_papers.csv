61,38764024,Using image segmentation models to analyse high-resolution earth observation data: new tools to monitor disease risks in changing environments,"Trujillano F, Jimenez G, Manrique E, Kahamba NF, Okumu F, Apollinaire N, Carrasco-Escobar G, Barrett B, Fornace K.",Int J Health Geogr. 2024 May 19;23(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s12942-024-00371-w.,Trujillano F,Int J Health Geogr,2024,2024/05/19,PMC11102859,,10.1186/s12942-024-00371-w,"BACKGROUND: In the near future, the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases may expand to new sites due to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns caused by climate change. Therefore, there is a need to use recent technological advances to improve vector surveillance methodologies. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), often called drones, have been used to collect high-resolution imagery to map detailed information on mosquito habitats and direct control measures to specific areas. Supervised classification approaches have been largely used to automatically detect vector habitats. However, manual data labelling for model training limits their use for rapid responses. Open-source foundation models such as the Meta AI Segment Anything Model (SAM) can facilitate the manual digitalization of high-resolution images. This pre-trained model can assist in extracting features of interest in a diverse range of images. Here, we evaluated the performance of SAM through the Samgeo package, a Python-based wrapper for geospatial data, as it has not been applied to analyse remote sensing images for epidemiological studies.
RESULTS: We tested the identification of two land cover classes of interest: water bodies and human settlements, using different UAV acquired imagery across five malaria-endemic areas in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. We employed manually placed point prompts and text prompts associated with specific classes of interest to guide the image segmentation and assessed the performance in the different geographic contexts. An average Dice coefficient value of 0.67 was obtained for buildings segmentation and 0.73 for water bodies using point prompts. Regarding the use of text prompts, the highest Dice coefficient value reached 0.72 for buildings and 0.70 for water bodies. Nevertheless, the performance was closely dependent on each object, landscape characteristics and selected words, resulting in varying performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent models such as SAM can potentially assist manual digitalization of imagery by vector control programs, quickly identifying key features when surveying an area of interest. However, accurate segmentation still requires user-provided manual prompts and corrections to obtain precise segmentation. Further evaluations are necessary, especially for applications in rural areas.","Using image segmentation models to analyse high-resolution earth observation data: new tools to monitor disease risks in changing environmentsTrujillano F, Jimenez G, Manrique E, Kahamba NF, Okumu F, Apollinaire N, Carrasco-Escobar G, Barrett B, Fornace K.Int J Health Geogr. 2024 May 19;23(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s12942-024-00371-w.BACKGROUND: In the near future, the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases may expand to new sites due to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns caused by climate change.

Epub 2024 May 4.,Schoenhof R,J Dent,2024,2024/05/06,,,10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105042,"OBJECTIVES: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce synthetic images free from personal data. They hold significant value in medical research, where data protection is increasingly regulated. Panoramic radiographs (PRs) are a well-suited modality due to their significant level of standardization while simultaneously displaying a high degree of personally identifiable data.
METHODS: We produced synthetic PRs (syPRs) out of real PRs (rePRs) using StyleGAN2-ADA by NVIDIAÂ©. A survey was performed on 54 medical professionals and 33 dentistry students. They assessed 45 radiological images (20 rePRs, 20 syPRs, and 5 syPRcontrols) as real or synthetic and interpreted a single-image syPR according to the image quality (0-10) and 14 different items (agreement/disagreement). They also rated the importance for the profession (0-10). A follow-up was performed for test-retest reliability with >10 % of all participants.
RESULTS: Overall, the sensitivity was 78.2 % and the specificity was 82.5 %. For professionals, the sensitivity was 79.9 % and the specificity was 82.3 %. For students, the sensitivity was 75.5 % and the specificity was 82.7 %. In the single syPR-interpretation image quality was rated at a median of 6 and 11 items were considered as agreement. The importance for the profession was rated at a median score of 7. The Test-retest reliability yielded a value of 0.23 (Cohen's kappa).
CONCLUSIONS: The study marks a comprehensive testing to demonstrate that GANs can produce synthetic radiological images that even health professionals can sometimes not differentiate from real radiological images, thereby being genuinely considered authentic. This enables their utilization and/or modification free from personally identifiable information.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Synthetic images can be used for university teaching and patient education without relying on patient-related data. They can also be utilized to upscale existing training datasets to improve the accuracy of AI-based diagnostic systems. The study thereby supports clinical teaching as well as diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making.","Synthetic, non-person related panoramic radiographs created by generative adversarial networks in research, clinical, and teaching applicationsSchoenhof R, Schoenhof R, Blumenstock G, Lethaus B, Hoefert S.J Dent. 2024 Jul;146:105042. doi: 10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105042.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in neurogenesis, learning and memory. The reduction of BDNF is associated with the decrease in cognitive function in various neurological disorders. Few pre-clinical studies have reported on the effects of chemotherapy and medical stress on BDNF levels and cognition. The present study aimed to compare the effects of medical stress and cisplatin on serum BDNF levels and cognitive function in 9-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats to age-matched controls. Serum BDNF levels were collected longitudinally during cisplatin treatment, and cognitive function was assessed by novel object recognition (NOR) 14Â weeks post-cisplatin initiation. Terminal BDNF levels were collected 24Â weeks after cisplatin initiation. In cultured hippocampal neurons, we screened three neuroprotective agents, riluzole (an approved treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as the ampakines CX546 and CX1739. We assessed dendritic arborization by Sholl analysis and dendritic spine density by quantifying postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) puncta. Cisplatin and exposure to medical stress reduced serum BDNF levels and impaired object discrimination in NOR compared to age-matched controls. Pharmacological BDNF augmentation protected neurons against cisplatin-induced reductions in dendritic branching and PSD-95.

However, previous deep learning studies have utilized single-center data and limited acquisition parameters.
PURPOSE: Develop a generalizable CNN for lung segmentation in 1 H-MRI, robust to pathology, acquisition protocol, vendor, and center.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: A total of 809 1 H-MRI scans from 258 participants with various pulmonary pathologies (median age (range): 57 (6-85); 42% females) and 31 healthy participants (median age (range): 34 (23-76); 34% females) that were split into training (593 scans (74%); 157 participants (55%)), testing (50 scans (6%); 50 participants (17%)) and external validation (164 scans (20%); 82 participants (28%)) sets.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5-T and 3-T/3D spoiled-gradient recalled and ultrashort echo-time 1 H-MRI.
ASSESSMENT: 2D and 3D CNNs, trained on single-center, multi-sequence data, and the conventional spatial fuzzy c-means (SFCM) method were compared to manually delineated expert segmentations. Each method was validated on external data originating from several centers.

STATISTICAL TESTS: Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed significances of differences between acquisitions in the testing set. Friedman tests with post hoc multiple comparisons assessed differences between the 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and SFCM. Bland-Altman analyses assessed agreement with manually derived lung volumes. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The 3D CNN significantly outperformed its 2D analog and SFCM, yielding a median (range) DSC of 0.961 (0.880-0.987), Average HD of 1.63âmm (0.65-5.45) and XOR of 0.079 (0.025-0.240) on the testing set and a DSC of 0.973 (0.866-0.987), Average HD of 1.11âmm (0.47-8.13) and XOR of 0.054 (0.026-0.255) on external validation data.
DATA CONCLUSION: The 3D CNN generated accurate 1 H-MRI lung segmentations on a heterogenous dataset, demonstrating robustness to disease pathology, sequence, vendor, and center.

Epub 2023 Feb 17.BACKGROUND: Recently, deep learning via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has largely superseded conventional methods for proton (1 H)-MRI lung segmentation. However, previous deep learning studies have utilized single-center data and limited acquisition parameters.
PURPOSE: Develop a generalizable CNN for lung segmentation in 1 H-MRI, robust to pathology, acquisition protocol, vendor, and center.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: A total of 809 1 H-MRI scans from 258 participants with various pulmonary pathologies (median age (range): 57 (6-85); 42% females) and 31 healthy participants (median age (range): 34 (23-76); 34% females) that were split into training (593 scans (74%); 157 participants (55%)), testing (50 scans (6%); 50 participants (17%)) and external validation (164 scans (20%); 82 participants (28%)) sets.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5-T and 3-T/3D spoiled-gradient recalled and ultrashort echo-time 1 H-MRI.
ASSESSMENT: 2D and 3D CNNs, trained on single-center, multi-sequence data, and the conventional spatial fuzzy c-means (SFCM) method were compared to manually delineated expert segmentations. Each method was validated on external data originating from several centers.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and test an automatic assessment of lung impairment in COVID-19 associated pneumonia with machine learning regression models that predict markers of respiratory and cardiovascular functioning from radiograms and lung CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled a total of 605 COVID-19 cases admitted to Al Ain Hospital from 24 February to 1 July 2020 into the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age â¥ 18 years; inpatient admission; PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung CT available at PACS. We designed a CNN-based regression model to predict systemic oxygenation markers from lung CT and 2D diagnostic images of the chest. The 2D images generated by averaging CT scans were analogous to the frontal and lateral view radiograms. The functional (heart and breath rate, blood pressure) and biochemical findings (SpO<sub>2</sub>, H C O 3 -   , K +, Na +, anion gap, C-reactive protein) served as ground truth.
RESULTS: Radiologic findings in the lungs of COVID-19 patients provide reliable assessments of functional status with clinical utility. If fed to ML models, the sagittal view radiograms reflect dyspnea more accurately than the coronal view radiograms due to the smaller size and the lower model complexity. Mean absolute error of the models trained on single-projection radiograms was approximately 11Ã·12% and it dropped by 0.5Ã·1% if both projections were used (11.97 Â± 9.23 vs. 11.43 Â± 7.51%; p = 0.70). Thus, the ML regression models based on 2D images acquired in multiple planes had slightly better performance. The data blending approach was as efficient as the voting regression technique: 10.90 Â± 6.72 vs. 11.96 Â± 8.30%, p = 0.94. The models trained on 3D images were more accurate than those on 2D: 8.27 Â± 4.13 and 11.75 Â± 8.26%, p = 0.14 before lung extraction; 10.66 Â± 5.83 and 7.94 Â± 4.13%, p = 0.18 after the extraction. The lung extraction boosts 3D model performance unsubstantially (from 8.27 Â± 4.13 to 7.94 Â± 4.13%; p = 0.82). However, none of the differences between 3D and 2D were statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The constructed ML algorithms can serve as models of structure-function association and pathophysiologic changes in COVID-19. The algorithms can improve risk evaluation and disease management especially after oxygen therapy that changes functional findings. Thus, the structural assessment of acute lung injury speaks of disease severity.","Deep Learning-Based Automatic Assessment of Lung Impairment in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Predicting Markers of Hypoxia With Computer VisionStatsenko Y, Habuza T, Talako T, Pazniak M, Likhorad E, Pazniak A, Beliakouski P, Gelovani JG, Gorkom KN, Almansoori TM, Al Zahmi F, Qandil DS, Zaki N, Elyassami S, Ponomareva A, Loney T, Naidoo N, Mannaerts GHH, Al Koteesh J, Ljubisavljevic MR, Das KM.Front Med (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 26;9:882190. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2022.882190. eCollection 2022.BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is a potentially life-threatening condition that can be seen in pneumonia patients.

METHODS: The authors evaluated 28 whole hearts from consecutive sudden cardiac death cases attributed to BrS and 29 hearts from a comparator group comprised of noncardiac deaths (control subjects).

RESULTS: Of 28 BrS decedents (75% men; median age of death 25 years), death occurred in sleep or at rest in 24 of 28 (86%).

These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and result in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies.
METHODS: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions.
RESULTS: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels.
CONCLUSION: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.","Social-distancing fatigue: Evidence from real-time crowd-sourced traffic dataShearston JA, Martinez ME, Nunez Y, Hilpert M.Sci Total Environ. 2021 Oct 20;792:148336. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148336.

The purpose of this study was to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary detection of stages 1, 2, and 3 in ROP and to evaluate its generalizability across different populations and camera systems.
DESIGN: Diagnostic validation study of CNN for stage detection.
PARTICIPANTS: Retinal fundus images obtained from preterm infants during routine ROP screenings.
METHODS: Two datasets were used: 5943 fundus images obtained by RetCam camera (Natus Medical, Pleasanton, CA) from 9 North American institutions and 5049 images obtained by 3nethra camera (Forus Health Incorporated, Bengaluru, India) from 4 hospitals in Nepal. Images were labeled based on the presence of stage by 1 to 3 expert graders. Three CNN models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation on datasets from North America alone, Nepal alone, and a combined dataset and were evaluated on 2 held-out test sets consisting of 708 and 247 images from the Nepali and North American datasets, respectively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Convolutional neural network performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: Both the North American- and Nepali-trained models demonstrated high performance on a test set from the same population: AUROC, 0.99; AUPRC, 0.98; sensitivity, 94%; and AUROC, 0.97; AUPRC, 0.91; and sensitivity, 73%; respectively. However, the performance of each model decreased to AUROC of 0.96 and AUPRC of 0.88 (sensitivity, 52%) and AUROC of 0.62 and AUPRC of 0.36 (sensitivity, 44%) when evaluated on a test set from the other population. Compared with the models trained on individual datasets, the model trained on a combined dataset achieved improved performance on each respective test set: sensitivity improved from 94% to 98% on the North American test set and from 73% to 82% on the Nepali test set.
CONCLUSIONS: A CNN can identify accurately the presence of ROP stage in retinal images, but performance depends on the similarity between training and testing populations. We demonstrated that internal and external performance can be improved by increasing the heterogeneity of the training dataset features of the training dataset, in this case by combining images from different populations and cameras.","Deep Learning for the Diagnosis of Stage inÂ Retinopathy of Prematurity: Accuracy and Generalizability across Populations and CamerasChen JS, Coyner AS, Ostmo S, Sonmez K, Bajimaya S, Pradhan E, Valikodath N, Cole ED, Al-Khaled T, Chan RVP, Singh P, Kalpathy-Cramer J, Chiang MF, Campbell JP.Ophthalmol Retina. 2021 Oct;5(10):1027-1035. doi: 10.1016/j.oret.2020.12.013.

METHODS: A market-approved CNN (Moleanalyzer-Pro, FotoFinder Systems) was used for binary classifications of 100 dermoscopic images of FSL. The same lesions were used in a two-level reader study including 64 dermatologists (level I: dermoscopy only; level II: dermoscopy, clinical close-up images, textual information). Primary endpoints were the CNN's sensitivity and specificity in comparison with the dermatologists' management decisions in level II. Generalizability of the CNN results was tested by using four additional external data sets.
RESULTS: The CNN's sensitivity, specificityÂ and ROC AUC were 96.2% [87.0%-98.9%], 68.8% [54.7%-80.1%]Â and 0.929 [0.880-0.978], respectively. In level II, the dermatologists' management decisions showed a mean sensitivity of 84.2% [82.2%-86.2%] and specificity of 69.4% [66.0%-72.8%]. When fixing the CNN's specificity at the dermatologists' mean specificity (69.4%), the CNN's sensitivity (96.2% [87.0%-98.9%]) was significantly higher than that of dermatologists (84.2% [82.2%-86.2%]; pÂ <Â 0.001).

METHODS: An open online survey was sent through various social media platforms and was open for a period of 2 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 407 usable responses were obtained; the average age of respondents was 27.4 years. Typically, 93.6% of respondents reported an increase in their screen time since the lockdown was declared. The average increase in digital device usage was calculated at about 4.8 Â± 2.8 h per day.

This work aimed to investigate the sensory, affective, cognitive, and motor changes induced by an adaptation of the CCI model by applying a single ligature around the sciatic nerve.
METHODS: Mechanical allodynia was measured from day 1 to day 28 postsurgery by the von Frey test. The beam walking test (BWT) was conducted weekly until 28âdays after surgery.Â Anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and cognitive performance were assessed through the open field (OF), forced swimming (FS), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests, respectively, 21âdays after surgery.
RESULTS: The two CCI models, both Bennett and Xie's model (four ligatures of the sciatic nerve) and a modification of it (one ligature), induced mechanical allodynia, increased immobility in the FS, and reduced recognition index in the NOR. The exploratory behavior and time spent in the central part of the arena decreased, while the defensive behavior increased in the OF. The animals subjected to the two CCI models showed motor alterations in the BWT; however, autotomy was observed only in the group with four ligatures and not in the group with a single ligature.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall these results demonstrate that our adapted CCI model, using a single ligature around the sciatic nerve, induces sensory, affective, cognitive, and motor alterations comparable to the CCI model with four ligatures without generating autotomy. This adaptation to the CCI model may therefore represent an appropriate and more easily performed model for inducing neuropathic pain and study underlying mechanisms and effective treatments.","An Adapted Chronic Constriction Injury of the Sciatic Nerve Produces Sensory, Affective, and Cognitive Impairments: A Peripheral Mononeuropathy Model for the Study of Comorbid Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Neuropathic Pain in RatsMedeiros P, Dos Santos IR, JÃºnior IM, Palazzo E, da Silva JA, Machado HR, Ferreira SH, Maione S, Coimbra NC, de Freitas RL.Pain Med. 2021 Feb 23;22(2):338-351. doi: 10.1093/pm/pnaa206.BACKGROUND: Chronic constriction injury (CCI) is a model of neuropathic pain induced by four loose ligatures around the sciatic nerve.

METHODS: In 2,011 patients (49.7% female, median age 73 years [61-81]) included between 2009 and 2017, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses regarding the occurrence of FR. FRs were defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 4-6 despite successful recanalization in patients selected by MRI (n = 690) and CT (n = 1,321) with a sensitivity analysis considering only patients with mRS 5-6 as futile.
RESULTS: MRI as compared to CT resulted in similar rates of subsequent MT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.048, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.677-1.624). Rates of FR were as follows: 571/1,489 (38%) FR mRS 4-6 including 393/1,489 (26%) FR mRS 5-6.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including patients initially diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (CP) within a regional integrated healthcare system between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Imaging reports from these patients were extracted from the electronic medical record system and split into training, validation and implementation datasets. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was first developed through the training dataset to identify specific features (atrophy, calcification, pseudocyst, cyst and main duct dilatation) from free-text radiology reports. The validation dataset was applied to validate the performance by comparing against the manual chart review. The developed algorithm was then applied to the implementation dataset. We classified patients with calcification(s) or â¥2 radiographic features as advanced CP. We compared etiology, comorbid conditions, treatment parameters as well as survival between advanced CP and others diagnosed during the study period.
RESULTS: 6,346 patients were diagnosed with CP during the study period with 58,085 radiology studies performed. For individual features, NLP yielded sensitivity from 88.7% to 95.3%, specificity from 98.2% to 100.0%. A total of 3,672 patients met cohort inclusion criteria: 1,330 (36.2%) had evidence of advanced CP. Patients with advanced CP had increased frequency of smoking (57.8% vs. 43.0%), diabetes (47.6% vs. 35.9%) and underweight body mass index (6.6% vs. 3.6%), all p<0.001. Mortality from pancreatic cancer was higher in advanced CP (15.3/1,000 person-year vs. 2.8/1,000, p<0.001). Underweight BMI (HR 1.6, 95% CL 1.2, 2.1), smoking (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.1, 1.7) and diabetes (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.2, 1.6) were independent risk factors for mortality.
CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced CP experienced increased disease-related complications and pancreatic cancer-related mortality. Excess all-cause mortality was driven primarily by potentially modifiable risk factors including malnutrition, smoking and diabetes.","Characterization of patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis using natural language processing of radiology reportsXie F, Chen Q, Zhou Y, Chen W, Bautista J, Nguyen ET, Parker RA, Wu BU.PLoS One. 2020 Aug 19;15(8):e0236817. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0236817. eCollection 2020.STUDY AIM: To develop and apply a natural language processing algorithm for characterization of patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis in a diverse integrated U.S. healthcare system.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) and cardio phrenic lymph nodes (CPLN) are pathological findings of computed tomography (CT) and are relevant for surgical planning. Furthermore, mammographic breast density (BD) has shown an association with OC risk and might be prognostically relevant. However, it is not known if PC, CPLN, and BD are associated with aggressive OC subtypes and impaired OC survival. Herein, we investigated associations between three comprehensive image parameters and OC subtypes and survival.
METHODS: The MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective study that included 17,035 women (1991-1996). Tumor information on 159 OC and information on OC specific survival (last follow-up, 2017-12-31) was registered. The CT and mammography closest to diagnosis were evaluated (Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index PCI, CPLN, and BD). Associations between CT-PCI, CPLN, and BD vs. clinical stage [stage I vs. advanced stage (II-IV), histological type/grade (high grade serous and endometrioid vs. other subtypes], and OC-specific survival were analyzed by logistic and Cox regression.
RESULTS: There was a significant association between higher CT-PCI score and advanced clinical stage (adjusted OR 1.26 (1.07-1.49)), adjusted for age at diagnosis and histological type/grade. Increasing CT-PCI was significantly associated with impaired OC specific survival (adjusted HR 1.04 (1.01-1.07)), adjusted for age at diagnosis, histological type/grade, and clinical stage. There was no significant association between PCI and histological type/grade, nor between BD or CPLN vs. the studied outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Image PCI score was significantly associated with advanced clinical stages and impaired OC survival.

METHODS: This pivotal phase III randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of upfront combination of VB-111 and bevacizumab versus bevacizumab monotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive VB-111 1013 viral particles every 8 weeks in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (combination arm) or bevacizumab monotherapy (control arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: Enrolled were 256 patients at 57 sites. Median exposure to VB-111 was 4 months. The study did not meet its primary or secondary goals. Median OS was 6.8 versus 7.9 months in the combination versus control arm (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI: 0.91-1.59; Pâ=â0.19) and ORR was 27.3% versus 21.9% (Pâ=â0.26). A higher rate of grades 3-5 adverse events was reported in the combination arm (67% vs 40%), mainly attributed to a higher rate of CNS and flu-like/fever events. Trends for improved survival with combination treatment were seen in the subgroup of patients with smaller tumors and in patients who had a posttreatment febrile reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, upfront concomitant administration of VB-111 and bevacizumab failed to improve outcomes in rGBM. Change of treatment regimen, with the lack of VB-111 monotherapy priming, may explain the differences from the favorable phase II results.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients from 7 centers with advanced grade (G) 1/2 NETs from the pancreas (P)/small bowel (SB) initiating ST/WW were eligible. Computed tomography (CT)/MRI performed at prebaseline, baseline, and 3(Â±1) months of study entry were retrospectively reviewed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cohort included 240 and 204 HNC patients in the training and validation analysis, respectively. Clinical variables were scored prospectively and IBMs of the primary tumor and lymph nodes were extracted from planning CT-images. Clinical, IBM and combined models were created from multivariable Cox proportional-hazard analyses based on clinical features, IBMs, and both for LC, RC, DMFS and DFS.
RESULTS: Clinical variables identified in the multivariable analysis included tumor-site, WHO performance-score, tumor-stage and age. Bounding-box-volume describing the tumor volume and irregular shape, IBM correlation representing radiological heterogeneity, and LN_major-axis-length showing the distance between lymph nodes were included in the IBM models. The performance of IBM LC, RC, DMFS and DFS models (c-index(validated):0.62, 0.80, 0.68 and 0.65) were comparable to that of the clinical models (0.62, 0.76, 0.70 and 0.66).

The automation of hippocampal segmentation has been investigated in normal aging, epilepsy, and in Alzheimer's disease. Our first goal was to compare manual and automated hippocampal segmentation in ischemic stroke and to, secondly, study the impact of stroke lesion presence on hippocampal volume estimation. We used eight automated methods to segment T1-weighted MR images from 105 ischemic stroke patients and 39 age-matched controls sampled from the Cognition And Neocortical Volume After Stroke (CANVAS) study. The methods were: AdaBoost, Atlas-based Hippocampal Segmentation (ABHS) from the IDeALab, Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) using 3 atlas variants (Hammers, LPBA40 and Neuromorphometics), FIRST, FreeSurfer v5.3, and FreeSurfer v6.0-Subfields. A number of these methods were employed to re-segment the T1 images for the stroke group after the stroke lesions were masked (i.e., removed). The automated methods were assessed on eight measures: process yield (i.e. segmentation success rate), correlation (Pearson's R and Shrout's ICC), concordance (Lin's RC and Kandall's W), slope 'a' of best-fit line from correlation plots, percentage of outliers from Bland-Altman plots, and significance of control-stroke difference. We eliminated the redundant measures after analysing between-measure correlations using Spearman's rank correlation. We ranked the automated methods based on the sum of the remaining non-redundant measures where each measure ranged between 0 and 1. Subfields attained an overall score of 96.3%, followed by AdaBoost (95.0%) and FIRST (94.7%). CAT using the LPBA40 atlas inflated hippocampal volumes the most, while the Hammers atlas returned the smallest volumes overall. FIRST (pâ¯=â¯0.014), FreeSurfer v5.3 (pâ¯=â¯0.007), manual tracing (pâ¯=â¯0.049), and CAT using the Neuromorphometics atlas (pâ¯=â¯0.017) all showed a significantly reduced hippocampal volume mean for the stroke group compared to control at three months. Moreover, masking of the stroke lesions prior to segmentation resulted in hippocampal volumes which agreed less with manual tracing. These findings recommend an automated segmentation without lesion masking as a more reliable procedure for the estimation of hippocampal volume in ischemic stroke.","A comparison of automated segmentation and manual tracing in estimating hippocampal volume in ischemic stroke and healthy control participantsKhlif MS, Egorova N, Werden E, Redolfi A, Boccardi M, DeCarli CS, Fletcher E, Singh B, Li Q, Bird L, Brodtmann A.Neuroimage Clin. 2019;21:101581. doi: 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.10.019. Epub 2018 Oct 22.Manual quantification of the hippocampal atrophy state and rate is time consuming and prone to poor reproducibility, even when performed by neuroanatomical experts. The automation of hippocampal segmentation has been investigated in normal aging, epilepsy, and in Alzheimer's disease. Our first goal was to compare manual and automated hippocampal segmentation in ischemic stroke and to, secondly, study the impact of stroke lesion presence on hippocampal volume estimation. We used eight automated methods to segment T1-weighted MR images from 105 ischemic stroke patients and 39 age-matched controls sampled from the Cognition And Neocortical Volume After Stroke (CANVAS) study. The methods were: AdaBoost, Atlas-based Hippocampal Segmentation (ABHS) from the IDeALab, Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) using 3 atlas variants (Hammers, LPBA40 and Neuromorphometics), FIRST, FreeSurfer v5.3, and FreeSurfer v6.0-Subfields.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment CT radiomic features to predict overall survival of esophageal cancer patients after chemoradiotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two datasets of independent centers were analyzed, consisting of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) and 41.4Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery if feasible. In total, 1049 radiomic features were calculated from the primary tumor volume. Recursive feature elimination was performed to select the 40 most relevant predictors. Using these 40 features and six clinical variables as input, two random forest (RF) models predicting 3-year overall survival were developed.
RESULTS: In total 165 patients from center 1 and 74 patients from center 2 were used. The radiomics-based RF model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95%CI 0.61-0.77), with the top-5 most important features for 3-year survival describing tumor heterogeneity after wavelet filtering. In the validation dataset, the RF model yielded an AUC of 0.61 (95%CI 0.47-0.75). Kaplan Meier plots were significantly different between risk groups in the training dataset (pâ=â.027) and borderline significant in the validation dataset (pâ=â.053).

So far, there is still a lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools to sensitively detect AD in early stages and to predict individual disease progression. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) of the brain may be a promising novel tool. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether multifrequency-MRE (MMRE) can detect differences in hippocampal stiffness between patients with clinical diagnosis of dementia due to AD and healthy controls (HC). Further, we analyzed if the combination of three MRI-derived parameters, i.e., hippocampal stiffness, hippocampal volume and mean diffusivity (MD), improves diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic criteria for probable dementia due to AD were in line with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and were verified through history-taking (patient and informant), neuropsychological testing, routine blood results and routine MRI to exclude other medical causes of a cognitive decline. 21 AD patients and 21 HC (median age 75Â years) underwent MMRE and structural MRI, from which hippocampal volume and MD were calculated. From the MMRE-images maps of the magnitude |G*| and phase angle Ï of the complex shear modulus were reconstructed using multifrequency inversion. Median values of |G*| and Ï were extracted within three regions of interest (hippocampus, thalamus and whole brain white matter).

Therefore neuroimaging biomarkers are of particular interest in HAND. In this study, we constructed brain connectivity profiles of 40Â subjects (20 HIV positive subjects and 20 age-matched seronegative controls) using two different methods: a non-linear mutual connectivity analysis approach and a conventional method based on Pearson's correlation. These profiles were then summarized using graph-theoretic methods characterizing their topological network properties. Standard clinical and laboratory assessments were performed and a battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests was administered for all participating subjects. Based on NP testing, 14 of the seropositive subjects exhibited mild neurologic impairment. Subsequently, we analyzed associations between the network derived measures and neuropsychological assessment scores as well as common clinical laboratory plasma markers (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA) after adjusting for age and gender. Mutual connectivity analysis derived graph-theoretic measures, Modularity and Small Worldness, were significantly (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05, FDR adjusted) associated with the Executive as well as Overall z-score of NP performance. In contrast, network measures derived from conventional correlation-based connectivity did not yield any significant results. Thus, changes in connectivity can be captured using advanced time-series analysis techniques. The demonstrated associations between imaging-derived graph-theoretic properties of brain networks with neuropsychological performance, provides opportunities to further investigate the evolution of HAND in larger, longitudinal studies.

However, recent MRI studies have reported increased cortical thickness of visual and somatosensory areas in patients with migraine with aura, suggesting that such structural alterations were either due to increased neuronal density in the areas involved, or a result of multiple episodes of cortical spreading depression as part of aura attacks. Subsequent studies have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to methodological reasons, e.g. small number of subjects. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited females aged 30-60 years from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Brain MRI of females with migraine with aura (patients), their co-twins, and unrelated migraine-free twins (controls) were performed at a single centre and assessed for cortical thickness in predefined cortical areas (V1, V2, V3A, MT, somatosensory cortex), blinded to headache diagnoses. The difference in cortical thickness between patients and controls adjusted for age, and other potential confounders was assessed. Comparisons of twin pairs discordant for migraine with aura were also performed. Comparisons were based on 166 patients, 30 co-twins, and 137 controls. Compared with controls, patients had a thicker cortex in areas V2 [adjusted mean difference 0.032 mm (95% confidence interval 0.003 to 0.061), V3A [adjusted mean difference 0.037 mm (95% confidence interval 0.008 to 0.067)], while differences in the remaining areas examined were not statistically significant [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): V1 0.022 (-0.007 to 0.052); MT: 0.018 (-0.011 to 0.047); somatosensory cortex: 0.020 (-0.009 to 0.049)].

In this cross-sectional study, we recruited females aged 30-60 years from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Brain MRI of females with migraine with aura (patients), their co-twins, and unrelated migraine-free twins (controls) were performed at a single centre and assessed for cortical thickness in predefined cortical areas (V1, V2, V3A, MT, somatosensory cortex), blinded to headache diagnoses. The difference in cortical thickness between patients and controls adjusted for age, and other potential confounders was assessed. Comparisons of twin pairs discordant for migraine with aura were also performed. Comparisons were based on 166 patients, 30 co-twins, and 137 controls. Compared with controls, patients had a thicker cortex in areas V2 [adjusted mean difference 0.032 mm (95% confidence interval 0.003 to 0.061), V3A [adjusted mean difference 0.037 mm (95% confidence interval 0.008 to 0.067)], while differences in the remaining areas examined were not statistically significant [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): V1 0.022 (-0.007 to 0.052); MT: 0.018 (-0.011 to 0.047); somatosensory cortex: 0.020 (-0.009 to 0.049)]. We found no association between the regions of interest and active migraine, or number of lifetime aura attacks. Migraine with aura discordant twin pairs (n = 30) only differed in mean thickness of V2 (0.039 mm, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.074). In conclusion, females with migraine with aura have a thicker cortex corresponding to visual areas and our results indicate this may be an inherent trait rather than a result of repeated aura attacks.",True,1,computer vision,['visual']

Understanding the association between amyloid aggregation and cognitive manifestation in persons without dementia is important for a better understanding of the course of AD and for the design of prevention trials.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether amyloid-Î² aggregation is associated with cognitive functioning in persons without dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 2908 participants with normal cognition and 4133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from 53 studies in the multicenter Amyloid Biomarker Study. Normal cognition was defined as having no cognitive concerns for which medical help was sought and scores within the normal range on cognitive tests. Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed according to published criteria. Study inclusion began in 2013 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed in January 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Global cognitive performance as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and episodic memory performance as assessed by a verbal word learning test. Amyloid aggregation was measured with positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and dichotomized as negative (normal) or positive (abnormal) according to study-specific cutoffs. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between amyloid aggregation and low cognitive scores (MMSE score â¤27 or memory z scoreâ¤-1.28) and to assess whether this association was moderated by age, sex, educational level, or apolipoprotein E genotype.
RESULTS: Among 2908 persons with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [12.8] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory scores after age 70 years (mean difference in amyloid positive vs negative, 4% [95% CI, 0%-7%] at 72 years and 21% [95% CI, 10%-33%] at 90 years) but was not associated with low MMSE scores (mean difference, 3% [95% CI, -1% to 6%], Pâ=â.16). Among 4133 patients with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.5] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory (mean difference, 16% [95% CI, 12%-20%], Pâ<â.001) and low MMSE (mean difference, 14% [95% CI, 12%-17%], Pâ<â.001) scores, and this association decreased with age. Low cognitive scores had limited utility for screening of amyloid positivity in persons with normal cognition and those with MCI. In persons with normal cognition, the age-related increase in low memory score paralleled the age-related increase in amyloid positivity with an intervening period of 10 to 15 years.

Whether this condition is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is beneficial in persons with MS and CCSVI is controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of venous PTA in patients with MS and CCSVI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 177 patients with relapsing-remitting MS; 62 were ineligible, including 47 (26.6%) who did not have CCSVI on color Doppler ultrasonography screening. A total of 115 patients were recruited in the study timeframe. All patients underwent a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group trial in 6 MS centers in Italy. The trial began in August 2012 and concluded in March 2016; data were analyzed from April 2016 to September 2016. The analysis was intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to either venous PTA or catheter venography without venous angioplasty (sham).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two primary end points were assessed at 12 months: (1) a composite functional measure (ie, walking control, balance, manual dexterity, postvoid residual urine volume, and visual acuity) and (2) a measure of new combined brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, including the proportion of lesion-free patients. Combined lesions included T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions plus new or enlarged T2 lesions.
RESULTS: Of the included 115 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, 76 were allocated to the PTA group (45 female [59%]; mean [SD] age, 40.0 [10.3] years) and 39 to the sham group (29 female [74%]; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [10.6] years); 112 (97.4%) completed follow-up. No serious adverse events occurred. Flow restoration was achieved in 38 of 71 patients (54%) in the PTA group. The functional composite measure did not differ between the PTA and sham groups (41.7% vs 48.7%; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.34-1.68; Pâ=â.49). The mean (SD) number of combined lesions on magnetic resonance imaging at 6 to 12 months were 0.47 (1.19) in the PTA group vs 1.27 (2.65) in the sham group (mean ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.91; Pâ=â.03: adjusted Pâ=â.09) and were 1.40 (4.21) in the PTA group vs 1.95 (3.73) in the sham group at 0 to 12 months (mean ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.32-1.63; Pâ=â.45; adjusted Pâ=â.45). At follow-up after 6 to 12 months, 58 of 70 patients (83%) in the PTA group and 22 of 33 (67%) in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.11-6.28; Pâ=â.03; adjusted Pâ=â.09).

OBJECTIVE: To determine if detectable brain changes occur during a 2-year period in HIV-positive individuals who were aviremic and treated with cART.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this longitudinal case-control study, participants underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment approximately 2 years apart. Data were collected from October 26, 2011, to March 1, 2016. Data from 92 HIV-positive individuals were acquired at Washington University in St Louis from ongoing studies conducted in the infectious disease clinic and AIDS Clinical Trial Unit. A total of 55 HIV-negative control participants were recruited from the St Louis community and a research participant registry. A total of 48 HIV-positive individuals who were aviremic and treated with cART and 31 demographically similar HIV-negative controls met the study requirements and were included in the analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brain volumes were extracted with tensor-based and voxel-based morphometry and cortical modeling. Raw scores from neuropsychological tests quantified cognitive performance. Multivariable mixed-effects models assessed the effect of HIV serostatus on brain volumes and cognitive performance, and determined if HIV serostatus affected how these measures changed over time. With HIV-positive participants, linear regression models tested whether brain volumes and cognitive performance were associated with measures of infection severity and duration of infection.
RESULTS: The 2 groups were demographically similar (HIV-positive group: 23 women and 25 men; mean [SD] age, 47.7 [13.2] years; mean [SD] educational level, 13.3 [3.4] years; and HIV-negative group, 16 women and 15 men; mean [SD] age, 51.2 [12.9] years; mean [SD] educational level, 14.5 [2.1] years).

Only changes in Trail Making Test Part A significantly differed between the groups. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were smaller in HIV-positive individuals compared with controls.

The biggest challenge is to distinguish communicating hydrocephalus from ventricular dilatation secondary to brain atrophy, because both conditions share common clinical and neuroradiological features. The main purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between ventriculomegaly, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, aqueductal and cervical CSF flows, and CSF opening pressure in MPS patients, and to provide potential biomarkers for abnormal CSF circulation.
METHODS: Forty-three MPS patients (12 MPS I, 15 MPS II, 5 MPS III, 9 MPS IV A and 2 MPS VI) performed clinical and developmental tests, and T1, T2, FLAIR and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by a lumbar puncture with the CSF opening pressure assessment. For the analysis of MRI variables, we measured the brain and CSF volumes, white matter (WM) lesion load, Evans' index, third ventricle width, callosal angle, dilated perivascular spacesÂ (PVS), craniocervical junction stenosis, aqueductal and cervical CSF stroke volumes, and CSF glycosaminoglycans concentration.
RESULTS: All the scores used to assess the supratentorial ventricles enlargement and the ventricular CSF volume presented a moderate correlation with the aqueductal CSF stroke volume (ACSV). The CSF opening pressure did not correlate either with the three measures of ventriculomegaly, or the ventricular CSF volume, or with the ACSV. Dilated PVS showed a significant association with the ventriculomegaly, ventricular CSF volume and elevated ACSV.

METHODS: FDG-PET/CT indices and clinicopathological parameters were assessed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). After completion of chemotherapy, all patients had breast surgery with axillary lymph node dissection, followed by radiation therapy and endocrine therapy for 5Â years.

METHODS: Six- and 12-month changes in regional MRI volumes and PSP Rating Scale scores were examined in 55 patients with PSP and 33 patients with CBS (78% amyloid PET negative) compared to 30 normal controls from a multicenter natural history study. Longitudinal voxel-based morphometric analyses identified patterns of volume loss, and region-of-interest analyses examined rates of volume loss in brainstem (midbrain, pons, superior cerebellar peduncle), cortical, and subcortical regions based on previously validated atlases.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible correlation between fatigue and morpho-volumetric features and site of dilated perivascular spaces (dPS), visible on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) in fatigued multiple sclerosis patients (FMS).
METHODS: We studied 82 relapsing remitting (RR) FMS patients and 43 HC, matched for age, sex, and education. F was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). To evaluate a possible correlation between degree of F and characteristics of dPS, patients were divided in two groups: more (mFMS) (FSSââ¥â5; nâ=â30) and less fatigued (lFMS) (FSSââ¥â4; nâ=â52), compared to a matched healthy control (HC) subject group. The MR study was performed with 3T scanner by SpinEcho T1, Fast-SpinEcho DP-T2, FLAIR, and 3D FSPGR T1 sequences. dPS volumes were measured with Medical Image Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV); Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA), expressed as Brain Parenchymal Fraction (BPF), was assessed by FSL SIENAX.
RESULTS: The t test showed significantly increased dPS number (pâ=â0.021) in FMS patients (mFMS pâ=â0.0024 and lFMS pâ=â0.033) compared to HC. Pearson correlation revealed a significant correlation between dPS number and FSS (râ=â0.208 pâ=â0.051).

Epub 2016 Jul 16.INTRODUCTION: Fatigue (F) is a common, inexplicable, and disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible correlation between fatigue and morpho-volumetric features and site of dilated perivascular spaces (dPS), visible on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) in fatigued multiple sclerosis patients (FMS).
METHODS: We studied 82 relapsing remitting (RR) FMS patients and 43 HC, matched for age, sex, and education. F was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). To evaluate a possible correlation between degree of F and characteristics of dPS, patients were divided in two groups: more (mFMS) (FSSââ¥â5; nâ=â30) and less fatigued (lFMS) (FSSââ¥â4; nâ=â52), compared to a matched healthy control (HC) subject group. The MR study was performed with 3T scanner by SpinEcho T1, Fast-SpinEcho DP-T2, FLAIR, and 3D FSPGR T1 sequences. dPS volumes were measured with Medical Image Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV); Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA), expressed as Brain Parenchymal Fraction (BPF), was assessed by FSL SIENAX.
RESULTS: The t test showed significantly increased dPS number (pâ=â0.021) in FMS patients (mFMS pâ=â0.0024 and lFMS pâ=â0.033) compared to HC. Pearson correlation revealed a significant correlation between dPS number and FSS (râ=â0.208 pâ=â0.051). Furthermore, the chi-squared test confirms the intragroup (HC, mFMS, lFMS) differences about dPS location (pâ=â0.01) and size (pâ=â0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that PS in MS patients presents with different volumetric and site characteristics as compared to HC; moreover, F severity significantly correlates with dPS number, site, and size.",True,1,computer vision,[]

METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) data of 57 patients (40 males; median age, 66 years) undergoing TEVAR for thoracic aortic aneurysm (34 TAA, 19 TAAA) or penetrating aortic ulcer (nâ=â4) between 2001 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. In 28 patients, the Gore TAGÂ® stent-graft was used, followed by the Medtronic ValiantÂ® in 16 cases, the Medtronic TalentÂ® in 8, and the Cook ZenithÂ® in 5 cases. Proximal landing zone (PLZ) was in zone 1 in 13, zone 2 in 13, zone 3 in 23, and zone 4 in 8 patients. In 14 patients (25%), the procedure was urgent or emergent. In each case, pre- and postoperative CT angiography was analyzed using a dedicated image processing workstation and complimentary in-house developed software based on a 3D cylindrical intensity model to calculate aortic arch angulation and conicity of the landing zones (LZ).
RESULTS: Primary type Ia endoleak rate was 12% (7/57) and subsequent re-intervention rate was 86% (6/7). Left subclavian artery (LSA) coverage (pâ=â0.036) and conicity of the PLZ (5.9 vs. 2.6 mm; pâ=â0.016) were significantly associated with an increased type Ia endoleak rate.

Patients from the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center with ADPKD (n=590) with computed tomography/magnetic resonance images and three or more eGFR measurements over â¥6 months were classified radiologically as typical (n=538) or atypical (n=52). Total kidney volume (TKV) was measured using stereology (TKVs) and ellipsoid equation (TKVe). Typical patients were randomly partitioned into development and internal validation sets and subclassified according to height-adjusted TKV (HtTKV) ranges for age (1A-1E, in increasing order). Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Study of PKD (CRISP) participants (n=173) were used for external validation. TKVe correlated strongly with TKVs, without systematic underestimation or overestimation. A longitudinal mixed regression model to predict eGFR decline showed that log2HtTKV and age significantly interacted with time in typical patients, but not in atypical patients. When 1A-1E classifications were used instead of log2HtTKV, eGFR slopes were significantly different among subclasses and, except for 1A, different from those in healthy kidney donors. The equation derived from the development set predicted eGFR in both validation sets.

Epub 2014 Jun 5.The rate of renal disease progression varies widely among patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), necessitating optimal patient selection for enrollment into clinical trials. Patients from the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center with ADPKD (n=590) with computed tomography/magnetic resonance images and three or more eGFR measurements over â¥6 months were classified radiologically as typical (n=538) or atypical (n=52). Total kidney volume (TKV) was measured using stereology (TKVs) and ellipsoid equation (TKVe). Typical patients were randomly partitioned into development and internal validation sets and subclassified according to height-adjusted TKV (HtTKV) ranges for age (1A-1E, in increasing order). Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Study of PKD (CRISP) participants (n=173) were used for external validation. TKVe correlated strongly with TKVs, without systematic underestimation or overestimation. A longitudinal mixed regression model to predict eGFR decline showed that log2HtTKV and age significantly interacted with time in typical patients, but not in atypical patients. When 1A-1E classifications were used instead of log2HtTKV, eGFR slopes were significantly different among subclasses and, except for 1A, different from those in healthy kidney donors. The equation derived from the development set predicted eGFR in both validation sets. The frequency of ESRD at 10 years increased from subclass 1A (2.4%) to 1E (66.9%) in the Mayo cohort and from 1C (2.2%) to 1E (22.3%) in the younger CRISP cohort.

Deauville response criteria consist of five ordinal categories based on visual comparison of residual tumor uptake to physiological reference uptakes. However, PET-response is a continuum and visual assessments can be distorted by optical illusions.
OBJECTIVES: With a novel semi-automatic quantification tool we eliminate optical illusions and extend the Deauville score to a continuous scale.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: SUVpeak of residual tumors and average uptake of the liver is measured with standardized volumes of interest. The qPET value is the quotient of these measurements. Deauville scores and qPET-values were determined in 898 pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma patients after two OEPA chemotherapy cycles.
RESULTS: Deauville categories translate to thresholds on the qPET scale: Categories 3, 4, 5 correspond to qPET values of 0.95, 1.3 and 2.0, respectively. The distribution of qPET values is unimodal with a peak representing metabolically normal responses and a tail of clearly abnormal outliers. In our patients, the peak is at qPET = 0.95 coinciding with the border between Deauville 2 and 3. qPET cut values of 1.3 or 2 (determined by fitting mixture models) select abnormal metabolic responses with high sensitivity, respectively, specificity.

The full-length cDNA of CiVDAC1 was 995Â bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 852Â bp that encodes a putative 283-amino acid protein. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the complete ORF of CiVDAC1 demonstrated high identity with well characterized mammalian homologs. The deduced CiVDAC1 protein contains an Î±-helix at the amino terminal, 19 membrane-spanning Î²-strands, and one eukaryotic mitochondrial porin signature motif. Tissue tropism analysis indicated that CiVDAC1 is abundant in muscle, heart, skin, swim bladder, trunk kidney and spleen. Transcriptional expression profiles indicated that the CiVDAC1 gene was upregulated upon viral challenge in a manner similar to the Mx2 gene, which is a marker gene used to indicate activation of innate antiviral immunity. Similar expression patterns of the CiVDAC1 gene were observed in CIK cells stimulated with poly (I:C), as well as grass carp kidney tissue challenged with GCRV inÂ vivo. CiVDAC1 silencing in CIK cells had no impact on progeny virus production, but over-expression of CiVDAC1 inÂ vivo showed strongly protect against challenge with live virus.

However, the changes in brain structure that accompany normal aging, and the role they play in cognitive decline, remain to be fully elucidated.
AIMS: This study aims to characterize changes in brain structure in old age, and to investigate relationships between brain aging and cognitive decline using the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Here, we report the rationale, design and methodology of the brain and neurovascular imaging protocol developed to study this cohort.
DESIGN: An observational, longitudinal study of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, which comprises 1091 relatively healthy individuals now in their 70s and living in the Edinburgh area. They are surviving participants of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947, which involved a test of general intelligence taken at age 11 years. At age 70 years, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 undertook detailed cognitive, medical and genetic testing, and provided social, family, nutritional, quality of life and physical activity information. At mean age 73 years they underwent detailed brain MRI and neurovascular ultrasound imaging, repeat cognitive and other testing. The MRI protocol is designed to provide qualitative and quantitative measures of gray and white matter atrophy, severity and location of white matter lesions, enlarged perivascular spaces, brain mineral deposits, microbleeds and integrity of major white matter tracts. The neurovascular ultrasound imaging provides velocity, stenosis and intima-media thickness measurements of the carotid and vertebral arteries.
STUDY: This valuable imaging dataset will be used to determine which changes in brain structural parameters have the largest effects on cognitive aging. Analysis will include multimodal image analysis and multivariate techniques, such as factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Especially valuable is the ability within this sample to examine the influence that early life intelligence has on brain structural parameters in old age, and the role of genetic, vascular, educational and lifestyle factors.
OUTCOMES: Final outcomes include associations between early and late life cognition and integrity of key white matter tracts, volume of gray and white matter, myelination, brain water content, and visible abnormalities such as white matter lesions and mineral deposits; and influences of vascular risk factors, diet, environment, social metrics, education and genetics on healthy brain aging.

Recent studies have suggested that some effects of transplanted stem cells are due to bystander effects that modulate the host environment, rather than direct effects of cell replacement. The extract from human adipose stem cells (ASCs) that secrete multiple growth factors including cytokines and chemokines may be a potential source of bystander effects for the treatment of epilepsy, in which inflammation is thought to play an important role. Here, we investigated the effects of a cytosolic extract of human ASCs (ASCs-E) in a mouse model of epilepsy.
METHODS: Human ASCs-E, boiled ASCs-E, or fibroblast-extract (fibroblast-E) was intraperitoneally administrated to C57BL/6 mice 15 min before pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) or during chronic epileptic stage. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage was evaluated by measuring Evans blue dye extravasation. Spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) was investigated by long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. The mice performed elevated plus maze, open-field, light/dark transition, and novel object recognition tasks.
KEY FINDINGS: Acute application of human ASCs-E before SE led to earlier attenuation of seizure spike activities after treatment with diazepam, reduction of BBB leakage, and inhibition of the development of epilepsy. Human ASCs-E treatment (for 7 days) during the chronic epileptic stage suppressed SRS and reduced abnormal epileptic behavioral phenotypes. However, neither boiled ASCs-E nor fibroblast-E had any effects in the experimental epilepsy model.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that human ASCs-E prevents or inhibits epileptogenesis and SRS in mice. They also suggest a stem cell-based, noninvasive therapy for the treatment of epilepsy.","A cell-free extract from human adipose stem cells protects mice against epilepsyJeon D, Chu K, Lee ST, Jung KH, Kang KM, Ban JJ, Kim S, Seo JS, Won CH, Kim M, Lee SK, Roh JK.Epilepsia. 2011 Sep;52(9):1617-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03182.x.

Severe combined immunodeficient mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and encephalitis was induced by intracranial injection of autologous HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs).

Epub 2004 Sep 30.,Kumar R,Childs Nerv Syst,2005,2004/10/02,,,10.1007/s00381-004-1029-9,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a necrotizing bacterial infection with protean manifestation and wide distribution. There has been a great fall in the prevalence of tuberculosis in the United States since 1990, although the impact of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has increased the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB). Spinal tuberculosis is the commonest form of skeletal tuberculosis. In this article, an overview of spinal tuberculosis and the personal experience of 19 children with spinal tuberculosis are presented. All the children required surgical intervention, because they manifested neurological deficit. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL FEATURES: The spinal tuberculosis is a result of hematogenous dissemination from primary focus in the lungs or the lymph nodes. The central type of vertebral tuberculosis spreads along with Batson's plexus of veins, while paradiscal infection spreads through the arteries. The anterior type of vertebral body tuberculosis results from the extension of the abscess beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament and periosteum. Two types of bone and joint tuberculosis are recognized: the caseous, exudative type with abscess formation, which is more common in children, and the granular type is frequent in adults. Only 7 of the 19 children had an abscess, while 10 manifested mainly granulation tissue. Although spinal tuberculosis is an extradural disease, 2 children had intramedullary granulomas and presented a tumor-like syndrome as rare manifestations. It was interesting to encounter intradural granulation and organized intradural granuloma causing cord compression in 2 children. A frank abscess with clumping of nerve roots was encountered in the cauda of another child without vertebral involvement. There is a controversy regarding the age predilection of the disease; it is documented that it is a disease of adults in affluent countries, and a disease of the first three decades in other regions.
DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging is extremely useful in diagnosing the difficult and rare sites of disease like the craniovertebral junction. It detects the marrow changes, exudative and granulation types, extra- and intradural disease, and radiological response to treatment in the early follow-up period around 6-8 weeks.
TREATMENT: Opinion varies regarding the operative indication for Pott's spine. A large group of surgeons perform debridement and decompression in all cases, irrespective of neurological involvement. Others perform operative decompression only in those patients who do not respond to chemotherapy. We did surgical interventions in children with moderate to severe neurological deficits manifesting radiological compression of their neuraxis. Depending on the site of involvement and type of disease the surgical approach was decided in individual cases. Two children with healed Pott's spine also required surgery because of their spinal deformations, which caused gradual neurological deficits and pain in both. Prognosis depends on many factors; the magnitude of cord compression, duration of neural complication, age and general condition of patient. Fifteen of our children made a remarkable recovery. Children with paraplegia also made an excellent recovery of their strength and sensations.","Spinal tuberculosis: with reference to the children of northern IndiaKumar R.Childs Nerv Syst. 2005 Jan;21(1):19-26. doi: 10.1007/s00381-004-1029-9.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to prospectively identify, using objective criteria, patients who are at high risk of recurrence and might benefit from additional treatment. We conducted a multi-institutional, collaborative case-control study to identify nuclear morphometric features that would be useful for identifying women with DCIS at the highest risk of recurrence. Tissue sections of archival breast tissue of 29 women with recurrent and 73 matched women with nonrecurrent DCIS were stained for DNA, and nuclei in the DCIS lesions were evaluated by image analysis. A clear correlation between mean fractal2_area (FA2) and nuclear grade was observed (P < 0.001), allowing an objective determination of nuclear grade. Several nuclear morphometric features, including mean and variance of variation of radius, mean area, mean and variance of frequency of high boundary harmonics (FQH), and variance in sphericity, were found to be useful in discriminating recurrent from nonrecurrent DCIS subjects. However, the nuclear features associated with recurrence differed between high- and low-grade lesions. For lesions with high FA2 (nuclear grade 3), mean variation of radius, mean FQH, and mean area alone yielded recurrence odds ratios of 4.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-45.96], 3.86 (95% CI, 0.88-16.98), 2.90 (95% CI, 0.31-27.2), respectively. Using a summed feature model, high-FA2 lesions showing three poor prognostic features had an odds ratio of 15.63 (95% CI, 1.22-200), compared with those with zero or one poor prognostic feature. Lesions with low mean FA2 (nuclear grade 1 or 2) showing high variances in sphericity and FQH had an odds ratio of 7.71 (95% CI, 1.77-33.60). Addition of other features did not enhance the odds ratio or its significance. These results suggest that nuclear image analysis of DCIS lesions may provide an adjunctive tool to conventional pathological analysis, both for the objective assessment of nuclear grade and for the identification of features that predict patient outcome.","Quantitative nuclear morphometry by image analysis for prediction of recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breastHoque A, Lippman SM, Boiko IV, Atkinson EN, Sneige N, Sahin A, Weber DM, Risin S, Lagios MD, Schwarting R, Colburn WJ, Dhingra K, Follen M, Kelloff GJ, Boone CW, Hittelman WN.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2001 Mar;10(3):249-59.Clinical management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains a challenge because significant proportions of patients experience recurrence after conservative surgical treatment.

Subjective assessment by radiologists indicated relative risks on the order of 4 to 6 for the group of women whose mammograms showed a density of over 75% or more of the projected area compared to those with an absence of density. In order to obtain a more quantitative, continuous and reproducible means of estimating breast density, which is sensitive to small changes, we have developed quantitative methods for the analysis of mammographic density, which can be applied to digitized mammograms. These techniques have been validated in a nested case-control study on 708 women aged 40-59 years (on entry) who participated in a national mammographic screening study. An interactive image segmentation method and two completely automated techniques based on image texture and grey scale histogram measures have been developed and evaluated. While our methods all show statistically significant risk factors for dense breasts, the interactive method currently provides the highest risk values (relative risk 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.12-7.56) compared to a measure based on the shape of the image histogram (relative risk 3.35, 95% CI = 1.57-7.12) or the fractal dimension of the mammogram (relative risk 2.54, 95% CI = 1.14-5.68). All methods were highly consistent between images of the left and right breast and between the two standard views (cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique) of each breast, so that studies can be done by sampling only one of the four views per examination. There is a large number of factors in addition to breast density which affect the appearance of the mammogram. In particular, the assessment of density is made difficult where the breast is not uniformly compressed, e.g. at the periphery. We have designed and are currently evaluating an image processing algorithm that effectively corrects for this problem and have considered methods for controlling some of the variables of image acquisition in prospective studies. Measurements of breast density may be helpful in assigning risk groups to women. Such measurements might guide the frequency of mammographic screening, aid the study of breast cancer aetiology, and be useful in monitoring possible risk-modifying interventions. Using our techniques, we have been able to show that reduction of the proportion of fat in the diet can result in reductions of breast density, although the direct connection to risk has not yet been made. The relationship between breast density and hormone-related and genetic factors is also of great interest. It is often not possible or ethical to obtain mammograms on some groups of women for whom information on density would be very useful. This includes younger women as well as groups in which it would be desirable to obtain such information at frequent intervals.

Online ahead of print.,Zhang X,Med Phys,2024,2024/07/23,,,10.1002/mp.17319,"BACKGROUND: Forty to fifty percent of women and 13%-22% of men experience an osteoporosis-related fragility fracture in their lifetimes. After the age of 50 years, the risk of hip fracture doubles in every 10 years. x-Ray based DXA is currently clinically used to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk. However, it provides only 2-D representation of bone and is associated with other technical limitations. Thus, alternative methods are needed.
PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate an ultra-low dose (ULD) hip CT-based automated method for assessment of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at proximal femoral subregions.
METHODS: An automated method was developed to segment the proximal femur in ULD hip CT images and delineate femoral subregions. The computational pipeline consists of deep learning (DL)-based computation of femur likelihood map followed by shape model-based femur segmentation and finite element analysis-based warping of a reference subregion labeling onto individual femur shapes. Finally, vBMD is computed over each subregion in the target image using a calibration phantom scan. A total of 100 participants (50 females) were recruited from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study, and ULD hip CT imaging, equivalent to 18 days of background radiation received by U.S. residents, was performed on each participant. Additional hip CT imaging using a clinical protocol was performed on 12 participants and repeat ULD hip CT was acquired on another five participants. ULD CT images from 80 participants were used to train the DL network; ULD CT images of the remaining 20 participants as well as clinical and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate the accuracy, generalizability, and reproducibility of segmentation of femoral subregions. Finally, clinical CT and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate accuracy and reproducibility of ULD CT-based automated measurements of femoral vBMD.
RESULTS: Dice scores of accuracy (nÂ =Â 20), reproducibility (nÂ =Â 5), and generalizability (nÂ =Â 12) of ULD CT-based automated subregion segmentation were 0.990, 0.982, and 0.977, respectively, for the femoral head and 0.941, 0.970, and 0.960, respectively, for the femoral neck. ULD CT-based regional vBMD showed Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients of 0.994 and 0.977, respectively, and a root-mean-square coefficient of variation (RMSCV) (%) of 1.39% with the clinical CT-derived reference measure. After 3-digit approximation, each of Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between baseline and repeat scans were 0.996 with RMSCV of 0.72%. Results of ULD CT-based bone analysis on 100 participants (age (meanÂ Â±Â SD) 73.6Â Â±Â 6.6 years) show that males have significantly greater (pÂ <Â 0.01) vBMD at the femoral head and trochanteric regions than females, while females have moderately greater vBMD (pÂ =Â 0.05) at the medial half of the femoral neck than males.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning, combined with shape model and finite element analysis, offers an accurate, reproducible, and generalizable algorithm for automated segmentation of the proximal femur and anatomic femoral subregions using ULD hip CT images. ULD CT-based regional measures of femoral vBMD are accurate and reproducible and demonstrate regional differences between males and females.","Ultra-low dose hip CT-based automated measurement of volumetric bone mineral density at proximal femoral subregionsZhang X, Nadeem SA, DiCamillo PA, Shibli-Rahhal A, Regan EA, Barr RG, Hoffman EA, Comellas AP, Saha PK.Med Phys. 2024 Jul 23. doi: 10.1002/mp.17319. Online ahead of print.BACKGROUND: Forty to fifty percent of women and 13%-22% of men experience an osteoporosis-related fragility fracture in their lifetimes. After the age of 50 years, the risk of hip fracture doubles in every 10 years. x-Ray based DXA is currently clinically used to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk. However, it provides only 2-D representation of bone and is associated with other technical limitations. Thus, alternative methods are needed.
PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate an ultra-low dose (ULD) hip CT-based automated method for assessment of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at proximal femoral subregions.
METHODS: An automated method was developed to segment the proximal femur in ULD hip CT images and delineate femoral subregions. The computational pipeline consists of deep learning (DL)-based computation of femur likelihood map followed by shape model-based femur segmentation and finite element analysis-based warping of a reference subregion labeling onto individual femur shapes. Finally, vBMD is computed over each subregion in the target image using a calibration phantom scan. A total of 100 participants (50 females) were recruited from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study, and ULD hip CT imaging, equivalent to 18 days of background radiation received by U.S. residents, was performed on each participant. Additional hip CT imaging using a clinical protocol was performed on 12 participants and repeat ULD hip CT was acquired on another five participants. ULD CT images from 80 participants were used to train the DL network; ULD CT images of the remaining 20 participants as well as clinical and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate the accuracy, generalizability, and reproducibility of segmentation of femoral subregions. Finally, clinical CT and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate accuracy and reproducibility of ULD CT-based automated measurements of femoral vBMD.
RESULTS: Dice scores of accuracy (nÂ =Â 20), reproducibility (nÂ =Â 5), and generalizability (nÂ =Â 12) of ULD CT-based automated subregion segmentation were 0.990, 0.982, and 0.977, respectively, for the femoral head and 0.941, 0.970, and 0.960, respectively, for the femoral neck. ULD CT-based regional vBMD showed Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients of 0.994 and 0.977, respectively, and a root-mean-square coefficient of variation (RMSCV) (%) of 1.39% with the clinical CT-derived reference measure. After 3-digit approximation, each of Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between baseline and repeat scans were 0.996 with RMSCV of 0.72%. Results of ULD CT-based bone analysis on 100 participants (age (meanÂ Â±Â SD) 73.6Â Â±Â 6.6 years) show that males have significantly greater (pÂ <Â 0.01) vBMD at the femoral head and trochanteric regions than females, while females have moderately greater vBMD (pÂ =Â 0.05) at the medial half of the femoral neck than males.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning, combined with shape model and finite element analysis, offers an accurate, reproducible, and generalizable algorithm for automated segmentation of the proximal femur and anatomic femoral subregions using ULD hip CT images. ULD CT-based regional measures of femoral vBMD are accurate and reproducible and demonstrate regional differences between males and females.",True,0,text mining,['deep learning']

Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of automated SMM quantification compared to manual quantification. We evaluated both diagnostic accuracy for low muscle mass and associations of SMM (change) with survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.

Automated L3-selection and automated segmentation was performed with Quantib Body Composition v0.2.1. Bland-Altman analyses, within-subject coefficients of variation (WSCVs) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to evaluate the agreement between manual and automatic segmentation. Diagnostic accuracy for low muscle mass (defined by an established sarcopenia cut-off) was calculated with manual assessment as the ""gold standard"". Using either manual or automated assessment, Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were used to study the association between changes in SMM (>5% decrease yes/no) during first-line metastatic CRC treatment and mortality adjusted for prognostic factors. SMM change was also assessed separately in weight-stable (<5%, i.e. occult SMM loss) patients.
RESULTS: In total, 1580 CT scans were analyzed, while a subset of 307 scans were analyzed in the fully-automated comparison. Included patients (nÂ =Â 553) had a mean age of 63Â Â±Â 9 years and 39% were female. The semi-automated comparison revealed a bias ofÂ -2.41Â cm2, 95% limits of agreement [-9.02 to 4.20], a WSCV of 2.25%, and an ICC of 0.99 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.97 to 1.00).

Both proteins share partial overlapping functions in epithelial development and EpCAM expression but have not been comparatively analyzed together in bladder carcinomas. TROP2 constitutes the target for the antibody-drug conjugate Sacituzumab govitecan (SG; TrodelvyTM) which has been approved for treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) irrespective of its TROP2 expression status.
METHODS: To evaluate the potential clinical significance of subtle differences in TROP2 and EpCAM expression in urothelial bladder cancer, both proteins were analyzed by multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry in combination with a deep-learning based algorithm for automated cell detection on more than 2,700 urothelial bladder carcinomas in a tissue microarray (TMA) format.
RESULTS: The staining pattern of TROP2 and EpCAM were highly similar. For both proteins, the staining intensity gradually decreased from pTa G2 low grade (TROP2: 68.8Â±36.1; EpCAM: 21.5Â±11.7) to pTa G2 high grade (64.6Â±38.0; 19.3Â±12.2) and pTa G3 (52.1Â±38.7; 16.0Â±13.0, p<0.001 each). In pT2-4 carcinomas, the average TROP2 and EpCAM staining intensity was intermediate (61.8Â±40.9; 18.3Â±12.3). For both proteins, this was significantly lower than in pTa G2 low grade (p<0.001 each) but also higher than in pTa G3 tumors (p=0.022 for TROP2, p=0.071 for EpCAM). Within pT2-4 carcinomas, the TROP2 and EpCAM staining level was unrelated to pT, grade, UICC-category, and overall or tumor-specific patient survival.

CONCLUSION: Our data show that TROP2 and EpCAM expression is common and highly interrelated in urothelial neoplasms. Despite of a progressive loss of TROP2/EpCAM during tumor cell dedifferentiation in pTa tumors, the lack of associations with clinicopathological parameters in pT2-4 cancer argues against a major cancer driving role of both proteins for the progression of urothelial neoplasms.","Loss of TROP2 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule expression is linked to grade progression in pTa but unrelated to disease outcome in pT2-4 urothelial bladder carcinomasMÃ¼ller JH, Plage H, Elezkurtaj S, Mandelkow T, Huang Z, Lurati MCJ, Raedler JB, Debatin NF, Vettorazzi E, Samtleben H, Hofbauer S, Furlano K, Neymeyer J, Goranova I, Ralla B, Weinberger S, Horst D, RoÃner F, Schallenberg S, Marx AH, Fisch M, Rink M, Slojewski M, Kaczmarek K, Ecke T, Hallmann S, Koch S, Adamini N, Lennartz M, Minner S, Simon R, Sauter G, Zecha H, Schlomm T, Bady E.Front Oncol. 2024 Jan 12;13:1342367. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1342367. eCollection 2023.INTRODUCTION: Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2; EpCAM2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is closely related to EpCAM (EpCAM; EpCAM1). Both proteins share partial overlapping functions in epithelial development and EpCAM expression but have not been comparatively analyzed together in bladder carcinomas. TROP2 constitutes the target for the antibody-drug conjugate Sacituzumab govitecan (SG; TrodelvyTM) which has been approved for treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) irrespective of its TROP2 expression status.
METHODS: To evaluate the potential clinical significance of subtle differences in TROP2 and EpCAM expression in urothelial bladder cancer, both proteins were analyzed by multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry in combination with a deep-learning based algorithm for automated cell detection on more than 2,700 urothelial bladder carcinomas in a tissue microarray (TMA) format.
RESULTS: The staining pattern of TROP2 and EpCAM were highly similar. For both proteins, the staining intensity gradually decreased from pTa G2 low grade (TROP2: 68.8Â±36.1; EpCAM: 21.5Â±11.7) to pTa G2 high grade (64.6Â±38.0; 19.3Â±12.2) and pTa G3 (52.1Â±38.7; 16.0Â±13.0, p<0.001 each). In pT2-4 carcinomas, the average TROP2 and EpCAM staining intensity was intermediate (61.8Â±40.9; 18.3Â±12.3). For both proteins, this was significantly lower than in pTa G2 low grade (p<0.001 each) but also higher than in pTa G3 tumors (p=0.022 for TROP2, p=0.071 for EpCAM). Within pT2-4 carcinomas, the TROP2 and EpCAM staining level was unrelated to pT, grade, UICC-category, and overall or tumor-specific patient survival. The ratio TROP2/EpCAM was unrelated to malignant phenotype and patient prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that TROP2 and EpCAM expression is common and highly interrelated in urothelial neoplasms. Despite of a progressive loss of TROP2/EpCAM during tumor cell dedifferentiation in pTa tumors, the lack of associations with clinicopathological parameters in pT2-4 cancer argues against a major cancer driving role of both proteins for the progression of urothelial neoplasms.",True,2,computer vision and text mining,"['dl', 'llm']"

Deficits in CEP composition measured using T2* biomarkers from UTE MRI are associated with more severe intervertebral disc degeneration in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP). The goal of this study was to develop an objective, accurate, and efficient deep-learning-based method for calculating biomarkers of CEP health using UTE images.
METHODS: Multi-echo UTE MRI of the lumbar spine was acquired from a prospectively enrolled cross-sectional and consecutive cohort of 83 subjects spanning a wide range of ages and cLBP-related conditions. CEPs from the L4-S1 levels were manually segmented on 6,972 UTE images and used to train neural networks utilizing the u-net architecture. CEP segmentations and mean CEP T2* values derived from manually- and model-generated segmentations were compared using Dice scores, sensitivity, specificity, Bland-Altman, and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios were calculated and related to model performance.
RESULTS: Compared with manual CEP segmentations, model-generated segmentations achieved sensitives of 0.80-0.91, specificities of 0.99, Dice scores of 0.77-0.85, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values of 0.99, and precision-recall (PR) AUC values of 0.56-0.77, depending on spinal level and sagittal image position. Mean CEP T2* values and principal CEP angles derived from the model-predicted segmentations had low bias in an unseen test dataset (T2* bias =0.33Â±2.37 ms, angle bias =0.36Â±2.65Â°). To simulate a hypothetical clinical scenario, the predicted segmentations were used to stratify CEPs into high, medium, and low T2* groups. Group predictions had diagnostic sensitivities of 0.77-0.86 and specificities of 0.86-0.95. Model performance was positively associated with image SNR and CNR.
CONCLUSIONS: The trained deep learning models enable accurate, automated CEP segmentations and T2* biomarker computations that are statistically similar to those from manual segmentations. These models address limitations with inefficiency and subjectivity associated with manual methods. Such techniques could be used to elucidate the role of CEP composition in disc degeneration etiology and guide emerging therapies for cLBP.","Deep-learning-based biomarker of spinal cartilage endplate health using ultra-short echo time magnetic resonance imagingBonnheim NB, Wang L, Lazar AA, Chachad R, Zhou J, Guo X, O'Neill C, Castellanos J, Du J, Jang H, Krug R, Fields AJ.Quant Imaging Med Surg. 2023 May 1;13(5):2807-2821. doi: 10.21037/qims-22-729.

Disaster medicine (DM) has recently gained prominence as a critical issue due to the high frequency of worldwide disasters, especially in 2021. The new artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technologies and concepts have recently progressed in DM education.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to familiarize the reader with the remote technologies that have been developed and used in DM education over the past 20 years.
LITERATURE SCOPING REVIEWS: Mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, deep learning (DL), and visual reality stimulation, e.g., head-mounted display (HMD), are selected as promising and inspiring designs in DM education.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on the remote technologies applied in DM pedagogy for medical, nursing, and social work, as well as other health discipline students, e.g., paramedics. Databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), ISI Web of Science (WOS), EBSCO (EBSCO Essentials), Embase (EMB), and Scopus were used. The sourced results were recorded in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart and followed in accordance with the PRISMA extension Scoping Review checklist. We included peer-reviewed articles, Epubs (electronic publications such as databases), and proceedings written in English. VOSviewer for related keywords extracted from review articles presented as a tabular summary to demonstrate their occurrence and connections among these DM education articles from 2000 to 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 1,080 research articles on remote technologies in DM were initially reviewed. After exclusion, 64 articles were included in our review. Emergency remote teaching/learning education, remote learning, online learning/teaching, and blended learning are the most frequently used keywords. As new remote technologies used in emergencies become more advanced, DM pedagogy is facing more complex problems.
DISCUSSIONS: Artificial intelligence-enhanced remote technologies promote learning incentives for medical undergraduate students or graduate professionals, but the efficacy of learning quality remains uncertain. More blended AI-modulating pedagogies in DM education could be increasingly important in the future. More sophisticated evaluation and assessment are needed to implement carefully considered designs for effective DM education.","The development of new remote technologies in disaster medicine education: A scoping reviewKao CL, Chien LC, Wang MC, Tang JS, Huang PC, Chuang CC, Shih CL.Front Public Health. 2023 Mar 24;11:1029558. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1029558. eCollection 2023.BACKGROUND: Remote teaching and online learning have significantly changed the responsiveness and accessibility after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Medical encounter notes can enrich structured EHR data with documented signs and symptoms of OUD and social risks and behaviors. To capture this information at scale, natural language processing (NLP) tools must be developed and evaluated. We developed and applied an annotation schema to deeply characterize OUD and related clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors, and automated the annotation schema using machine learning and deep learning-based approaches.
METHODS: Using the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database, we queried hospital discharge summaries of patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) OUD diagnostic codes. We developed an annotation schema to characterize problematic opioid use, identify individuals with potential OUD, and provide psychosocial context. Two annotators reviewed discharge summaries from 100 patients. We randomly sampled patients with their associated annotated sentences and divided them into training (66 patients; 2,127 annotated sentences) and testing (29 patients; 1,149 annotated sentences) sets. We used the training set to generate features, employing three NLP algorithms/knowledge sources. We trained and tested prediction models for classification with a traditional machine learner (logistic regression) and deep learning approach (Autogluon based on ELECTRA's replaced token detection model). We applied a five-fold cross-validation approach to reduce bias in performance estimates.
RESULTS: The resulting annotation schema contained 32 classes. We achieved moderate inter-annotator agreement, with F<sub>1</sub>-scores across all classes increasing from 48 to 66%. Five classes had a sufficient number of annotations for automation; of these, we observed consistently high performance (F<sub>1</sub>-scores) across training and testing sets for drug screening (training: 91-96; testing: 91-94) and opioid type (training: 86-96; testing: 86-99).

CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated that rich information regarding problematic opioid use can be manually identified by annotators.

So far, no study has evaluated whether ECG-based machine learning models have added value to predict in-hospital mortality specifically in COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: Using data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry, we studied 882 patients admitted with COVID-19 across seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Raw format 12-lead ECGs recorded within 72â¯h of admission were studied. With data from five hospitals (nâ¯=â634), three models were developed: (a)Â aÂ logistic regression baseline model using age and sex, (b)Â aÂ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model using age, sex and human annotated ECG features, and (c)Â aÂ pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) using age, sex and the raw ECG waveforms.

The retinal fundus is a window for human in vivo noninvasive assessment of the microvasculature. Large-scale complementary machine learning-based assessment of the retinal vasculature with phenome-wide and genome-wide analyses may yield new insights into human health and disease.
METHODS: We used 97â895 retinal fundus images from 54â813 UK Biobank participants. Using convolutional neural networks to segment the retinal microvasculature, we calculated vascular density and fractal dimension as a measure of vascular branching complexity. We associated these indices with 1866 incident International Classification of Diseases-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up) and 88 quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and ethnicity.
RESULTS: Low retinal vascular fractal dimension and density were significantly associated with higher risks for incident mortality, hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, anemia, and multiple ocular conditions, as well as corresponding quantitative traits. Genome-wide association of vascular fractal dimension and density identified 7 and 13 novel loci, respectively, that were enriched for pathways linked to angiogenesis (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, angiopoietin, and WNT signaling pathways) and inflammation (eg, interleukin, cytokine signaling).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the retinal vasculature may serve as a biomarker for future cardiometabolic and ocular disease and provide insights into genes and biological pathways influencing microvascular indices.

METHODS: Referable pterygium was defined as having extension towards the cornea from the limbus of >2.50âmm or base width at the limbus of >5.00âmm. 2503 images from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study were used as the development set. Algorithms were validated on an internal set from the SEED cohort (629 images (55.3% pterygium, 8.4% referable pterygium)), and tested on two external clinic-based sets (set 1 with 2610 images (2.8% pterygium, 0.7% referable pterygium, from slit-lamp ASP); and set 2 with 3701 images, 2.5% pterygium, 0.9% referable pterygium, from hand-held ASP).
RESULTS: The algorithm's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for detection of any pterygium was 99.5%(sensitivity=98.6%; specificity=99.0%) in internal test set, 99.1% (sensitivity=95.9%, specificity=98.5%) in external test set 1 and 99.7% (sensitivity=100.0%; specificity=88.3%) in external test set 2.

Deep learning neural network (DLNN) approach was considered in patients with brain stroke (BS) to predict and classify the outcome by the risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 332 patients with BS (mean age: 77.4 [standard deviation: 10.4] years, 50.6% - male) from Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ardabil, Iran, during 2008-2018 participated in this prospective study. Data were gathered from the available documents of the BS registry. Furthermore, the diagnosis of BS was considered based on computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. The DLNN strategy was applied to predict the effects of the main risk factors on mortality. The quality of the model was measured by diagnostic indices.
RESULTS: The finding of this study for 81 selected models demonstrated that ranges of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 90.5%-99.7%, 83.8%-100%, and 89.8%-99.5%, respectively. Based on the optimal model (tangent hyperbolic activation function with the minimum-maximum hidden units of 10-20, max epochs of 400, momentum of 0.5, and learning rate of 0.1), the most important predictors for BS mortality were time interval after 10 years (accuracy = 92.2%), age category (75.6%), the history of hyperlipoproteinemia (66.9%), and education level (66.9%). The other independent variables are at moderate importance (66.6%) which include sex, employment status, residential place, smoking habits, history of heart disease, cerebrovascular accident type, blood pressure, diabetes, oral contraceptive pill use, and physical activity.
CONCLUSION: The best means for dropping the BS load is effective BS prevention.

DESIGN: An interpretable, weakly supervised deep learning framework incorporating prior knowledge was proposed to analyse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore new prognostic phenotypes on pathological whole-slide images (WSIs) from the Zhongshan cohort of 1125 HCC patients (2451 WSIs) and TCGA cohort of 320 HCC patients (320 WSIs). A 'tumour risk score (TRS)' was established to evaluate patient outcomes, and then risk activation mapping (RAM) was applied to visualise the pathological phenotypes of TRS.

RESULTS: Survival analysis revealed that TRS was an independent prognosticator in both the Zhongshan cohort (p&lt;0.0001) and TCGA cohort (p=0.0003). The predictive ability of TRS was superior to and independent of clinical staging systems, and TRS could evenly stratify patients into up to five groups with significantly different prognoses.

Even after a fracture occurs, high fracture risk remains widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Common fracture risk assessment tools utilize a subset of clinical risk factors for prediction, and often require manual data entry. Furthermore, these tools predict risk over the long term and do not explicitly provide short-term risk estimates necessary to identify patients likely to experience a fracture in the next 1-2 years.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an algorithm for the identification of patients at risk of fracture in a subsequent 1- to 2-year period. In order to address the aforementioned limitations of current prediction tools, this approach focused on a short-term timeframe, automated data entry, and the use of longitudinal data to inform the predictions.
METHODS: Using retrospective electronic health record data from over 1,000,000 patients, we developed Crystal Bone, an algorithm that applies machine learning techniques from natural language processing to the temporal nature of patient histories to generate short-term fracture risk predictions. Similar to how language models predict the next word in a given sentence or the topic of a document, Crystal Bone predicts whether a patient's future trajectory might contain a fracture event, or whether the signature of the patient's journey is similar to that of a typical future fracture patient. A holdout set with 192,590 patients was used to validate accuracy. Experimental baseline models and human-level performance were used for comparison.
RESULTS: The model accurately predicted 1- to 2-year fracture risk for patients aged over 50 years (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUROC] 0.81). These algorithms outperformed the experimental baselines (AUROC 0.67) and showed meaningful improvements when compared to retrospective approximation of human-level performance by correctly identifying 9649 of 13,765 (70%) at-risk patients who did not receive any preventative bone-health-related medical interventions from their physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that it is possible to use a patient's unique medical history as it changes over time to predict the risk of short-term fracture. Validating and applying such a tool within the health care system could enable automated and widespread prediction of this risk and may help with identification of patients at very high risk of fracture.","Deep Learning With Electronic Health Records for Short-Term Fracture Risk Identification: Crystal Bone Algorithm Development and ValidationAlmog YA, Rai A, Zhang P, Moulaison A, Powell R, Mishra A, Weinberg K, Hamilton C, Oates M, McCloskey E, Cummings SR.J Med Internet Res. 2020 Oct 16;22(10):e22550. doi: 10.2196/22550.BACKGROUND: Fractures as a result of osteoporosis and low bone mass are common and give rise to significant clinical, personal, and economic burden.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine-learning model based on clinical features for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.
METHOD: 725 patients were used to train and validate the model. This included a retrospective cohort from Wuhan, China of 299 hospitalised COVID-19 patients from 23 December 2019 to 13 February 2020, and five cohorts with 426 patients from eight centres in China, Italy and Belgium from 20 February 2020 to 21 March 2020. The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalisation. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and metrics derived from the confusion matrix.
RESULTS: In the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50âyears and 137 (45.8%) were male. In the five test cohorts, the median age was 62âyears and 236 (55.4%) were male.

Studies comparing a market-approved CNN in a broad range of diagnoses to dermatologists working under less artificial conditions are lacking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred cases of pigmented/non-pigmented skin cancers and benign lesions were used for a two-level reader study in 96 dermatologists (level I: dermoscopy only; level II: clinical close-up images, dermoscopy, and textual information). Additionally, dermoscopic images were classified by a CNN approved for the European market as a medical device (Moleanalyzer Pro, FotoFinder Systems, Bad Birnbach, Germany). Primary endpoints were the sensitivity and specificity of the CNN's dichotomous classification in comparison with the dermatologists' management decisions. Secondary endpoints included the dermatologists' diagnostic decisions, their performance according to their level of experience, and the CNN's area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC).
RESULTS: The CNN revealed a sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 95.0% (95% CI 83.5% to 98.6%), 76.7% (95% CI 64.6% to 85.6%), and 0.918 (95% CI 0.866-0.970), respectively. In level I, the dermatologists' management decisions showed a mean sensitivity and specificity of 89.0% (95% CI 87.4% to 90.6%) and 80.7% (95% CI 78.8% to 82.6%). With level II information, the sensitivity significantly improved to 94.1% (95% CI 93.1% toÂ 95.1%; P < 0.001), while the specificity remained unchanged at 80.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 82.4%; PÂ = 0.97). When fixing the CNN's specificity at the mean specificity of the dermatologists' management decision in level II (80.4%), the CNN's sensitivity was almost equal to that of human raters, at 95% (95% CI 83.5% to 98.6%) versus 94.1% (95% CI 93.1% to 95.1%); PÂ = 0.1. In contrast, dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN in their level I management decisions and level I and II diagnostic decisions. More experienced dermatologists frequently surpassed the CNN's performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Under less artificial conditions and in a broader spectrum of diagnoses, the CNN and most dermatologists performed on the same level.

By training a deep neural network, further information in the mammographic images can be considered. Purpose To develop a risk score that is associated with future breast cancer and compare it with density-based models. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all women aged 40-74 years within the Karolinska University Hospital uptake area in whom breast cancer was diagnosed in 2013-2014 were included along with healthy control subjects. Network development was based on cases diagnosed from 2008 to 2012.

METHODS: T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time maps were analyzed for 4,384 subjects from the baseline Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) Dataset. Voxel Based Relaxometry (VBR) was used for automatic quantification and voxel-based analysis of the differences in T<sub>2</sub> between subjects with and without radiographic OA. A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet) was trained to diagnose OA from T<sub>2</sub> data. For comparison, more classical feature extraction techniques and shallow classifiers were used to benchmark the performance of our algorithm's results. Deep and shallow models were evaluated with and without the inclusion of risk factors. Sensitivity and Specificity values and McNemar test were used to compare the performance of the different classifiers.
RESULTS: The best shallow model was obtained when the first ten Principal Components, demographics and pain score were included as features (AUCÂ =Â 77.77%, SensitivityÂ =Â 67.01%, SpecificityÂ =Â 71.79%). In comparison, DenseNet trained on raw T<sub>2</sub> data obtained AUCÂ =Â 83.44%, SensitivityÂ =Â 76.99%, SpecificityÂ =Â 77.94%.

CONCLUSION: In this study, we presented a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based data-driven platform using T<sub>2</sub> measurements to characterize radiographic OA. Our results showed that feature learning from T<sub>2</sub> maps has potential in uncovering information that can potentially better diagnose OA than simple averages or linear patterns decomposition.","Diagnosing osteoarthritis from T(2) maps using deep learning: an analysis of the entire Osteoarthritis Initiative baseline cohortPedoia V, Lee J, Norman B, Link TM, Majumdar S.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2019 Jul;27(7):1002-1010. doi: 10.1016/j.joca.2019.02.800.

RESULTS: The best shallow model was obtained when the first ten Principal Components, demographics and pain score were included as features (AUCÂ =Â 77.77%, SensitivityÂ =Â 67.01%, SpecificityÂ =Â 71.79%). In comparison, DenseNet trained on raw T<sub>2</sub> data obtained AUCÂ =Â 83.44%, SensitivityÂ =Â 76.99%, SpecificityÂ =Â 77.94%. McNemar test on two misclassified proportions form the shallow and deep model showed that the boost in performance was statistically significant (McNemar's chi-squaredÂ =Â 10.33, degree of freedom (DF)Â =Â 1, P-valueÂ =Â 0.0013).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we presented a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based data-driven platform using T<sub>2</sub> measurements to characterize radiographic OA. Our results showed that feature learning from T<sub>2</sub> maps has potential in uncovering information that can potentially better diagnose OA than simple averages or linear patterns decomposition.",True,3,other,['deep learning']

Research into prognostication in ICU has so far been limited to data from admission or the first 24 hours. Most ICU admissions last longer than this, decisions are made throughout an admission, and some admissions are explicitly intended as time-limited prognostic trials. Despite this, temporal changes in prognostic ability during ICU admission has received little attention to date. Current predictive models, in the form of prognostic clinical tools, are typically derived from linear models and do not explicitly handle incremental information from trends. Machine learning (ML) allows predictive models to be developed which use non-linear predictors and complex interactions between variables, thus allowing incorporation of trends in measured variables over time; this has made it possible to investigate prognosis throughout an admission.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study uses ML to assess the predictability of ICU mortality as a function of time. Logistic regression against physiological data alone outperformed APACHE-II and demonstrated several important interactions including between lactate & noradrenaline dose, between lactate & MAP, and between age & MAP consistent with the current sepsis definitions. ML models consistently outperformed logistic regression with Deep Learning giving the best results. Predictive power was maximal on the second day and was further improved by incorporating trend data. Using a limited range of physiological and demographic variables, the best machine learning model on the first day showed an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.883 (Ï = 0.008), compared to 0.846 (Ï = 0.010) for a logistic regression from the same predictors and 0.836 (Ï = 0.007) for a logistic regression based on the APACHE-II score. Adding information gathered on the second day of admission improved the maximum AUC to 0.895 (Ï = 0.008). Beyond the second day, predictive ability declined.
CONCLUSION: This has implications for decision making in intensive care and provides a justification for time-limited trials of ICU therapy; the assessment of prognosis over more than one day may be a valuable strategy as new information on the second day helps to differentiate outcomes. New ML models based on trend data beyond the first day could greatly improve upon current risk stratification tools.","Optimal intensive care outcome prediction over time using machine learningMeiring C, Dixit A, Harris S, MacCallum NS, Brealey DA, Watkinson PJ, Jones A, Ashworth S, Beale R, Brett SJ, Singer M, Ercole A.PLoS One. 2018 Nov 14;13(11):e0206862. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0206862. eCollection 2018.BACKGROUND: Prognostication is an essential tool for risk adjustment and decision making in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Automated quantification of EPVS would greatly help to advance research into its etiology and its potential as a risk indicator of disease. We propose a convolutional network regression method to quantify the extent of EPVS in the basal ganglia from 3D brain MRI. We first segment the basal ganglia and subsequently apply a 3D convolutional regression network designed for small object detection within this region of interest. The network takes an image as input, and outputs a quantification score of EPVS. The network has significantly more convolution operations than pooling ones and no final activation, allowing it to span the space of real numbers. We validated our approach using a dataset of 2000 brain MRI scans scored visually. Experiments with varying sizes of training and test sets showed that a good performance can be achieved with a training set of only 200 scans. With a training set of 1000 scans, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between our scoring method and the expert's visual score was 0.74. Our method outperforms by a large margin - more than 0.10 - four more conventional automated approaches based on intensities, scale-invariant feature transform, and random forest. We show that the network learns the structures of interest and investigate the influence of hyper-parameters on the performance. We also evaluate the reproducibility of our network using a set of 60 subjects scanned twice (scan-rescan reproducibility). On this set our network achieves an ICC of 0.93, while the intrarater agreement reaches 0.80.

The AREDS 9-step detailed scale's complexity and implementation solely with highly trained fundus photograph graders potentially hampered its clinical use, warranting development and use of an alternate AREDS simple scale, which although valuable, has less predictive ability.
OBJECTIVE: To describe DL techniques for the AREDS 9-step detailed severity scale for AMD to estimate 5-year risk probability with reasonable accuracy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used data collected from November 13, 1992, to November 30, 2005, from 4613 study participants of the AREDS data set to develop deep convolutional neural networks that were trained to provide detailed automated AMD grading on several AMD severity classification scales, using a multiclass classification setting. Two AMD severity classification problems using criteria based on 4-step (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3, and AMD-4 from classifications developed for AREDS eligibility criteria) and 9-step (from AREDS detailed severity scale) AMD severity scales were investigated. The performance of these algorithms was compared with a contemporary human grader and against a criterion standard (fundus photograph reading center graders) used at the time of AREDS enrollment and follow-up. Three methods for estimating 5-year risk were developed, including one based on DL regression. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, through April 15, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Weighted Îº scores and mean unsigned errors for estimating 5-year risk probability of progression to advanced AMD.
RESULTS: This study used 67â¯401 color fundus images from the 4613 study participants. The weighted Îº scores were 0.77 for the 4-step and 0.74 for the 9-step AMD severity scales. The overall mean estimation error for the 5-year risk ranged from 3.5% to 5.3%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that DL AMD grading has, for the 4-step classification evaluation, performance comparable with that of humans and achieves promising results for providing AMD detailed severity grading (9-step classification), which normally requires highly trained graders, and for estimating 5-year risk of progression to advanced AMD. Use of DL has the potential to assist physicians in longitudinal care for individualized, detailed risk assessment as well as clinical studies of disease progression during treatment or as public screening or monitoring worldwide.","Use of Deep Learning for Detailed Severity Characterization and Estimation of 5-Year Risk Among Patients With Age-Related Macular DegenerationBurlina PM, Joshi N, Pacheco KD, Freund DE, Kong J, Bressler NM.JAMA Ophthalmol. 2018 Dec 1;136(12):1359-1366. doi: 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2018.4118.IMPORTANCE: Although deep learning (DL) can identify the intermediate or advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as a binary yes or no, stratified gradings using the more granular Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) 9-step detailed severity scale for AMD provide more precise estimation of 5-year progression to advanced stages.

Natural language processing (NLP) using large language models (LLMs) is a potentially more accurate method. To assess LLMs' potential for cirrhosis cohort identification, we compared code-based versus LLM-based classification with chart review as a ""gold standard.""
METHODS: We extracted and conducted a limited chart review of 3,788 discharge summaries of cirrhosis admissions. We engineered zero-shot prompts using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4 to determine whether cirrhosis and its complications were active hospitalization problems. We calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) of LLM-based classification versus limited chart review, and PPVs of code-based versus LLM-based classification as a ""silver standard"" in all 3,788 summaries.
RESULTS: Versus gold standard chart review, code-based classification achieved PPVs of 82.2% for identifying cirrhosis, 41.7% hepatic encephalopathy, 72.8% ascites, 59.8% gastrointestinal bleeding, and 48.8% spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Compared to chart review, GPT-4 achieved 87.8-98.8% accuracies for identifying cirrhosis and its complications. Using LLM as a silver standard, code-based classification achieved PPVs of 79.8% for identifying cirrhosis, 53.9% hepatic encephalopathy, 55.3% ascites, 67.6% gastrointestinal bleeding, and 65.5% spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
CONCLUSIONS: LLM-based classification was highly accurate versus manual chart review in identifying cirrhosis and its complications - this allowed us to assess the performance of code-based classification at scale using LLMs as a silver standard.

Epub 2024 Jul 18.,Sciannameo V,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2024,2024/07/19,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108326,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Researchers commonly use automated solutions such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to extract clinical information from large volumes of unstructured data. However, clinical text's poor semantic structure and domain-specific vocabulary can make it challenging to develop a one-size-fits-all solution. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), offer a promising solution for capturing and standardizing unstructured clinical information. This study evaluated the performance of InstructGPT, a family of models derived from LLM GPT-3, to extract relevant patient information from medical case reports and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs versus dedicated NLP methods.
METHODS: In this paper, 208 articles related to case reports of foreign body injuries in children were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A reviewer manually extracted information on sex, age, the object that caused the injury, and the injured body part for each patient to build a gold standard to compare the performance of InstructGPT.
RESULTS: InstructGPT achieved high accuracy in classifying the sex, age, object and body part involved in the injury, with 94%, 82%, 94% and 89%, respectively. When excluding articles for which InstructGPT could not retrieve any information, the accuracy for determining the child's sex and age improved to 97%, and the accuracy for identifying the injured body part improved to 93%. InstructGPT was also able to extract information from non-English language articles.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights that LLMs have the potential to eliminate the necessity for task-specific training (zero-shot extraction), allowing the retrieval of clinical information from unstructured natural language text, particularly from published scientific literature like case reports, by directly utilizing the PDF file of the article without any pre-processing and without requiring any technical expertise in NLP or Machine Learning. The diverse nature of the corpus, which includes articles written in languages other than English, some of which contain a wide range of clinical details while others lack information, adds to the strength of the study.","Information extraction from medical case reports using OpenAI InstructGPTSciannameo V, Pagliari DJ, Urru S, Grimaldi P, Ocagli H, Ahsani-Nasab S, Comoretto RI, Gregori D, Berchialla P.Comput Methods Programs Biomed. 2024 Oct;255:108326. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108326.

Commercially available LLMs, however, are not optimized for clinical uses and are prone to generating hallucinatory information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an enterprise architecture that allows the embedding of customized data into LLMs. This approach ""specializes"" the LLMs and is thought to reduce hallucinations.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We developed ""LiVersa,"" a liver disease-specific LLM, by using our institution's protected health information-complaint text embedding and LLM platform, ""Versa."" We conducted RAG on 30 publicly available American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidance documents to be incorporated into LiVersa. We evaluated LiVersa's performance by conducting 2 rounds of testing. First, we compared LiVersa's outputs versus those of trainees from a previously published knowledge assessment. LiVersa answered all 10 questions correctly. Second, we asked 15 hepatologists to evaluate the outputs of 10 hepatology topic questions generated by LiVersa, OpenAI's ChatGPT 4, and Meta's Large Language Model Meta AI 2. LiVersa's outputs were more accurate but were rated less comprehensive and safe compared to those of ChatGPT 4.

CONCLUSIONS: In this demonstration, we built disease-specific and protected health information-compliant LLMs using RAG. While LiVersa demonstrated higher accuracy in answering questions related to hepatology, there were some deficiencies due to limitations set by the number of documents used for RAG. LiVersa will likely require further refinement before potential live deployment.

RESULTS: We evaluated LiVersa's performance by conducting 2 rounds of testing. First, we compared LiVersa's outputs versus those of trainees from a previously published knowledge assessment. LiVersa answered all 10 questions correctly. Second, we asked 15 hepatologists to evaluate the outputs of 10 hepatology topic questions generated by LiVersa, OpenAI's ChatGPT 4, and Meta's Large Language Model Meta AI 2. LiVersa's outputs were more accurate but were rated less comprehensive and safe compared to those of ChatGPT 4.
CONCLUSIONS: In this demonstration, we built disease-specific and protected health information-compliant LLMs using RAG. While LiVersa demonstrated higher accuracy in answering questions related to hepatology, there were some deficiencies due to limitations set by the number of documents used for RAG. LiVersa will likely require further refinement before potential live deployment. The LiVersa prototype, however, is a proof of concept for utilizing RAG to customize LLMs for clinical use cases.",True,3,other,[]

Using medical record review to identify conditions within large quantities of EMRs can be time-consuming and inefficient. EMR-based phenotyping using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms is a continually developing area of study that holds potential for numerous mental health disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the current state of EMR-based case identification for depression and provides guidance on using current algorithms and constructing new ones.
METHODS: A scoping review of EMR-based algorithms for phenotyping depression was completed. This research encompassed studies published from January 2000 to May 2023. The search involved 3 databases: Embase, MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo. This was carried out using selected keywords that fell into 3 categories: terms connected with EMRs, terms connected to case identification, and terms pertaining to depression. This study adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 20 papers were assessed and summarized in the review. Most of these studies were undertaken in the United States, accounting for 75% (15/20). The United Kingdom and Spain followed this, accounting for 15% (3/20) and 10% (2/20) of the studies, respectively. Both data-driven and clinical rule-based methodologies were identified. The development of EMR-based phenotypes and algorithms indicates the data accessibility permitted by each health system, which led to varying performance levels among different algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: Better use of structured and unstructured EMR components through techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing has the potential to improve depression phenotyping. However, more validation must be carried out to have confidence in depression case identification algorithms in general.","Case Identification of Depression in Inpatient Electronic Medical Records: Scoping ReviewGrothman A, Ma WJ, Tickner KG, Martin EA, Southern DA, Quan H.JMIR Med Inform. 2024 Oct 14;12:e49781. doi: 10.2196/49781.BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) contain large amounts of detailed clinical information.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of language expressing doubt about patient clinical history (eg, experiences and symptoms) in hospital admission notes by patient race and ethnicity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, natural language processing tools were applied to analyze 54â¯936 admission notes from 1249 clinicians about patients aged 18 years or older at admission and hospitalized at an academic health system in the Northeast US between January 1, 2018, and February 28, 2023. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2022, to July 31, 2023.
EXPOSURE: Patient race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and racial and ethnic minoritized groups excluding non-Hispanic Black [includes multiple racial and ethnic groups, such as Hispanic and Asian]) as recorded in the EHR based on self-report or registrar determination.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Binary indicator for at least 1 term casting doubt on patient clinical history was defined using epistemic stance, a linguistic construct expressing a writer's degree of certainty in information.

South Asia, in particular, has seen limited development in this area of research, and applying existing models from other regions is challenging due to cost constraints and the region's distinct linguistics and behavior. Social media analysis, notably on platforms such as Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc), offers the potential for detecting major depressive disorder and aiding individuals at risk of suicidal ideation.
OBJECTIVE: This study primarily focuses on India and Bangladesh, both South Asian countries. It aims to construct a predictive model for suicidal ideation by incorporating unique, unexplored features along with masked content from both public and private Facebook profiles. Moreover, the research aims to fill the existing research gap by addressing the distinct challenges posed by South Asia's unique behavioral patterns, socioeconomic conditions, and linguistic nuances. Ultimately, this research strives to enhance suicide prevention efforts in the region by offering a cost-effective solution.
METHODS: This quantitative research study will gather data through a web-based platform. Initially, participants will be asked a few demographic questions and to complete the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire assessment. Eligible participants who provide consent will receive an email requesting them to upload a ZIP file of their Facebook data. The study will begin by determining whether Facebook is the primary application for the participants based on their active hours and Facebook use duration. Subsequently, the predictive model will incorporate a wide range of previously unexplored variables, including anonymous postings, and textual analysis features, such as captions, biographic information, group membership, preferred pages, interactions with advertisement content, and search history. The model will also analyze the use of emojis and the types of games participants engage with on Facebook.
RESULTS: The study obtained approval from the scientific review committee on October 2, 2023, and subsequently received institutional review committee ethical clearance on December 8, 2023. Our system is anticipated to automatically detect posts related to depression by analyzing the text and use pattern of the individual with the best accuracy possible. Ultimately, our research aims to have practical utility in identifying individuals who may be at risk of depression or in need of mental health support.
CONCLUSIONS: This initiative aims to enhance engagement in suicidal ideation medical care in South Asia to improve health outcomes. It is set to be the first study to consider predicting participants' primary social application use before analyzing their content to forecast behavior and mental states. The study holds the potential to revolutionize strategies and offer insights for scalable, accessible interventions while maintaining quality through comprehensive Facebook feature analysis.

Current systems, like those run by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP), face challenges due to manual vetting and disparities in carcinogen classification spurred by the volume of emerging data. To address these issues, we introduced the Carcinogen Detection via Transformers (CarD-T) framework, a text analytics approach that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic statistical analysis to efficiently nominate carcinogens from scientific texts. CarD-T uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) trained on PubMed abstracts featuring known carcinogens from IARC groups and includes a context classifier to enhance accuracy and manage computational demands. Using this method, journal publication data indexed with carcinogenicity & carcinogenesis Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms from the last 25 years was analyzed, identifying potential carcinogens. Training CarD-T on 60% of established carcinogens (Group 1 and 2A carcinogens, IARC designation), CarD-T correctly to identifies all of the remaining Group 1 and 2A designated carcinogens from the analyzed text. In addition, CarD-T nominates roughly 1500 more entities as potential carcinogens that have at least two publications citing evidence of carcinogenicity. Comparative assessment of CarD-T against GPT-4 model reveals a high recall (0.857 vs 0.705) and F1 score (0.875 vs 0.792), and comparable precision (0.894 vs 0.903). Additionally, CarD-T highlights 554 entities that show disputing evidence for carcinogenicity. These are further analyzed using Bayesian temporal Probabilistic Carcinogenic Denomination (PCarD) to provide probabilistic evaluations of their carcinogenic status based on evolving evidence. Our findings underscore that the CarD-T framework is not only robust and effective in identifying and nominating potential carcinogens within vast biomedical literature but also efficient on consumer GPUs. This integration of advanced NLP capabilities with vital epidemiological analysis significantly enhances the agility of public health responses to carcinogen identification, thereby setting a new benchmark for automated, scalable toxicological investigations.","CarD-T: Interpreting Carcinomic Lexicon via TransformersO'Neill J, Reddy GA, Dhillon N, Tripathi O, Alexandrov L, Katira P.medRxiv [Preprint]. 2024 Aug 31:2024.08.13.24311948. doi: 10.1101/2024.08.13.24311948.The identification and classification of carcinogens is critical in cancer epidemiology, necessitating updated methodologies to manage the burgeoning biomedical literature.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model for HCC incidence in a cohort of patients with MASLD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study was conducted among patients aged at least 18 years with MASLD, identified using diagnosis of MASLD using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes; natural language processing of radiology imaging report text, which identified patients who had imaging evidence of MASLD but had not been formally diagnosed; or the Dallas Steatosis Index, a risk equation that identifies individuals likely to have MASLD with good precision. Patients were enrolled from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health delivery system with more than 4.6 million members, with study entry between January 2009 and December 2018, and follow-up until HCC development, death, or study termination on September 30, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed during February 2023 and January 2024.
EXPOSURE: Data were extracted from the electronic health record and included 18 routinely measured factors associated with MASLD.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The cohort was split (70:30) into derivation and internal validation sets; extreme gradient boosting was used to model HCC incidence. HCC risk was divided into 3 categories, with the cumulative estimated probability of HCC 0.05% or less classified as low risk; 0.05% to 0.09%, medium risk; and 0.1% or greater, high risk.
RESULTS: A total of 1â¯811â¯461 patients (median age [IQR] at baseline, 52 [41-63] years; 982â¯300 [54.2%] female) participated in the study. During a median (range) follow-up of 9.3 (5.8-12.4) years, 946 patients developed HCC, for an incidence rate of 0.065 per 1000 person-years. The model achieved an area under the curve of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.882-0.916) in the validation set. At the medium-risk threshold, the model had a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 81.4%, and a number needed to screen of 406. At the high-risk threshold, the model had a sensitivity of 78.4%, a specificity of 90.1%, and a number needed to screen of 241.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This prognostic study of more than 1.8 million patients with MASLD used electronic health record data to develop a prediction model to discriminate between individuals with and without incident HCC with good precision.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the incidence of AF in patients admitted for ACS and to evaluate its association with adverse outcomes, given the recent advances in management of both diseases.
METHODS: Natural language processing search algorithms identified AF in patients admitted with ACS across 13 Northwell Health Hospitals from 2015 to 2021. Hierarchical generalized linear mixed modeling was used to assess the association between AF and in-hospital mortality, bleeding, and stroke outcomes; marginal Cox regression modeling was used to assess the association between AF and postdischarge mortality.
RESULTS: Of 12,315 patients admitted for ACS, 3018 (24.5%) had AF with 1609 (53.3%) newly diagnosed. AF patients more commonly received anticoagulation with an oral anticoagulant (80.4% vs 12.3%) or heparin (61.9% vs 56.9%), had lengthier intensive care unit stay (72 vs 49 hours), and underwent fewer percutaneous coronary interventions (31.9% vs 53.1%). In-hospital bleeding, stroke, and mortality were higher in the AF group (15.3% vs 5.0%, 7.4% vs 2.4%, and 6.9% vs 2.1%, respectively).

In addition, elevated pre-KF proteinuria was associated with KF/all-cause mortality events. CKD stage, nephrotic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease event rates, as well as the incremental costs of these events, were high.
BACKGROUND: FSGS leads to proteinuria and progressive decline in GFR, which correlates with kidney failure (KF) and increased cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effects of proteinuria on KF status/all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events/all-cause mortality, as well as the relationship between progression to KF and occurrence of CVD/mortality events among adult patients (18 years or older) with FSGS.
METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort study utilizing Optum deidentified Market Clarity Data and proprietary Natural Language Processing data. The study period was from January 1, 2007, through March 31, 2021, with patients in the overall cohort being identified from July 1, 2007, through March 31, 2021.

RESULTS: Elevated proteinuria >1.5 and â¥3.5 g/g increased the risk of KF/all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 2.34 [1.99 to 2.74] and 2.44 [2.09 to 2.84], respectively) and CVD/all-cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI], 2.11 [1.38 to 3.22] and 2.27 [1.44 to 3.58], respectively). Progression to KF was also associated with a higher risk of CVD/all-cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI], 3.04 [2.66 to 3.48]).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients with FSGS experience KF and CVD events. Elevated proteinuria and progression to KF were associated with a higher risk of CVD/all-cause mortality events, and elevated pre-KF proteinuria was associated with progression to KF/all-cause mortality events.

The project aims to ensure that the largest student population earns the necessary skills, and it has developed a two-tier system involving facilitators who will enable the efficient expansion of the projectâs educational outreach and support the students in learning the needed material efficiently. With a focus on real-world scenarios and innovative teaching activities integrating telemedicine devices and virtual professionals, SaNuRN is committed to enabling continuous learning for healthcare professionals in clinical practice. The SaNuRN team introduced new ways of evaluating healthcare professionals by shifting from a knowledge-based to a competencies-based evaluation, aligning with the Miller teaching pyramid and using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination and Script Concordance Test in digital health education. Drawing on the expertise of URN, CAU, and their public health and digital research laboratories and partners, the SaNuRN project represents a platform for continuous innovation, including telemedicine training and living labs with virtual and interactive professional activities. The SaNuRN project provides a comprehensive, personalized 30-hour training package for health and paramedical students, addressing all 70 FNRDH competencies. The program is enhanced using AI and NLP to create virtual patients and professionals for digital healthcare simulation. SaNuRN teaching materials are open-access. The project collaborates with academic institutions worldwide to develop educational material in digital health in English and multilingual formats. SaNuRN offers a practical and persuasive training approach to meet the current digital health education requirements.",True,1,computer vision,[]

STUDY DESIGN: âBetween mid-March and late April 2023, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic were prompted to provide references for specific obstetrical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2020. RCTs were considered for inclusion if they were mentioned in a previous article that primarily evaluated RCTs published by the top medical and obstetrics and gynecology journals with the highest impact factors in 2020 as well as RCTs published in a new journal focused on publishing obstetric RCTs. The selection of the three AI models was based on their popularity, performance in natural language processing, and public availability. Data collection involved prompting the AI chatbots to provide references according to a standardized protocol. The primary evaluation metric was the accuracy of each AI model in correctly citing references, including authors, publication title, journal name, and digital object identifier (DOI). Statistical analysis was performed using a permutation test to compare the performance of the AI models.
RESULTS: âAmong the 44 RCTs analyzed, Google Bard demonstrated the highest accuracy, correctly citing 13.6% of the requested RCTs, whereas ChatGPT and Chatsonic exhibited lower accuracy rates of 2.4 and 0%, respectively. Google Bard often substantially outperformed Chatsonic and ChatGPT in correctly citing the studied reference components. The majority of references from all AI models studied were noted to provide DOIs for unrelated studies or DOIs that do not exist.
CONCLUSION: âTo ensure the reliability of scientific information being disseminated, authors must exercise caution when utilizing AI for scientific writing and literature search. However, despite their limitations, collaborative partnerships between AI systems and researchers have the potential to drive synergistic advancements, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.

Epub 2023 Nov 23.,Micale C,Drug Saf,2024,2023/11/23,,,10.1007/s40264-023-01366-5,"INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is the leading cause of heart disease in the world, and discontinuation or nonadherence of antihypertensive medication constitutes a significant global health concern. Patients with hypertension have high rates of medication nonadherence. Studies of reasons for nonadherence using traditional surveys are limited, can be expensive, and suffer from response, white-coat, and recall biases. Mining relevant posts by patients on social media is inexpensive and less impacted by the pressures and biases of formal surveys, which may provide direct insights into factors that lead to non-compliance with antihypertensive medication.
METHODS: This study examined medication ratings posted to WebMD, an online health forum that allows patients to post medication reviews. We used a previously developed natural language processing classifier to extract indications and reasons for changes in angiotensin receptor II blocker (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatments. After extraction, ratings were manually annotated and compared with data from the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) public database.
RESULTS: From a collection of 343,459 WebMD reviews, we automatically extracted 1867 posts mentioning changes in ACEIs or ARBs, and manually reviewed the 300 most recent posts regarding ACEI treatments and the 300 most recent posts regarding ARB treatments. After excluding posts that only mentioned a dose change or were a false-positive mention, 142 posts in the ARBs dataset and 187 posts in the ACEIs dataset remained. The majority of posts (97% ARBs, 91% ACEIs) indicated experiencing an adverse event as the reason for medication change. The most common adverse events reported mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities were ""musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders"" like muscle and joint pain for ARBs, and ""respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders"" like cough and shortness of breath for ACEIs. These categories also had the largest differences in percentage points, appearing more frequently on WebMD data than FDA data (pÂ <Â 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal and respiratory symptoms were the most commonly reported adverse effects in social media postings associated with drug discontinuation.

Here we blend citizen science with innovation in NLP and ML to examine (1) which categories of life events persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) perceived as central for their MS; and (2) associated emotions. We subsequently relate our results to standardized individual-level measures. Participants (n = 1039) took part in the 'My Life with MS' study of the Swiss MS Registry which involved telling their story through self-selected life events using text descriptions and a semi-structured questionnaire. We performed topic modeling ('latent Dirichlet allocation') to identify high-level topics underlying the text descriptions. Using a pre-trained language model, we performed a fine-grained emotion analysis of the text descriptions. A topic modeling analysis of totally 4293 descriptions revealed eight underlying topics. Five topics are common in clinical research: 'diagnosis', 'medication/treatment', 'relapse/child', 'rehabilitation/wheelchair', and 'injection/symptoms'. However, three topics, 'work', 'birth/health', and 'partnership/MS' represent domains that are of great relevance for participants but are generally understudied in MS research. While emotions were predominantly negative (sadness, anxiety), emotions linked to the topics 'birth/health' and 'partnership/MS' was also positive (joy). Designed in close collaboration with persons with MS, the 'My Life with MS' project explores the experience of living with the chronic disease of MS using NLP and ML.

Many in this age group report substantial obstacles to receiving quality youth-centered mental health care services. With the rapid development of technology and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mobile health (mHealth) has presented new opportunities for youth mental health research, practice, and policy.
OBJECTIVE: The research objectives were to (1) synthesize the current evidence supporting mHealth interventions for youths who experience mental health challenges and (2) identify current gaps in the mHealth field related to youth's access to mental health services and health outcomes.
METHODS: Guided by the methods of Arksey and O'Malley, we conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed studies that used mHealth tools to improve youth mental health (January 2016-February 2022). We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases using the following key terms: (1) mHealth; (2) youth and young adults; and (3) mental health. The current gaps were analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: The search produced 4270 records, of which 151 met inclusion criteria. Included articles highlight the comprehensive aspects of youth mHealth intervention resource allocation for targeted conditions, mHealth delivery methods, measurement tools, evaluation of mHealth intervention, and youth engagement. The median age for participants in all studies is 17 (IQR 14-21) years. Only 3 (2%) studies involved participants who reported their sex or gender outside of the binary option. Many studies (68/151, 45%) were published after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Study types and designs varied, with 60 (40%) identified as randomized controlled trials. Notably, 143 out of 151 (95%) studies came from developed countries, suggesting an evidence shortfall on the feasibility of implementing mHealth services in lower-resourced settings. Additionally, the results highlight concerns related to inadequate resources devoted to self-harm and substance uses, weak study design, expert engagement, and the variety of outcome measures selected to capture impact or changes over time. There is also a lack of standardized regulations and guidelines for researching mHealth technologies for youths and the use of non-youth-centered approaches to implementing results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may be used to inform future work as well as the development of youth-centered mHealth tools that can be implemented and sustained over time for diverse types of youths. Implementation science research that prioritizes youths' engagement is needed to advance the current understanding of mHealth implementation. Moreover, core outcome sets may support a youth-centered measurement strategy to capture outcomes in a systematic way that prioritizes equity, diversity, inclusion, and robust measurement science.

In comparison, the Khorana score had a c statistic of 0.64 [95% CI 0.62-0.65]. The two risk scores had 80% concordance; the novel score reclassified 20% of Khorana score (3530 low-to-high with 9.0% VTE; 734 high-to-low with 3.4% VTE) and led to a 25% increment in VTEs captured in the high-risk group.

There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends.
OBJECTIVE: The key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports.
METHODS: The domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing.
RESULTS: The current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.

In addition to undermining maternal welfare, untreated postpartum psychopathology can result in child emotional and physical neglect and associated significant pediatric health costs. Some women may experience traumatic childbirth and develop posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after delivery (childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder). Although women are routinely screened for postpartum depression in the United States, there is no recommended protocol to inform the identification of women who are likely to experience childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Advancements in computational methods of free text have shown promise in informing the diagnosis of psychiatric conditions. Although the language in narratives of stressful events has been associated with posttrauma outcomes, whether the narratives of childbirth processed via machine learning can be useful for childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder screening is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the use of written narrative accounts of personal childbirth experiences for the identification of women with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. To this end, we developed a model based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder via the classification of birth narratives.
STUDY DESIGN: Overall, 1127 eligible postpartum women who enrolled in a study survey during the COVID-19 pandemic provided short written childbirth narrative accounts in which they were instructed to focus on the most distressing aspects of their childbirth experience. They also completed a posttraumatic stress disorder symptom screen to determine childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. After the exclusion criteria were applied, data from 995 participants were analyzed. A machine learning-based Sentence-Transformers natural language processing model was used to represent narratives as vectors that served as inputs for a neural network machine learning model developed in this study to identify participants with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder.
RESULTS: The machine learning model derived from natural language processing of childbirth narratives achieved good performance (area under the curve, 0.75; F1 score, 0.76; sensitivity, 0.8; specificity, 0.70). Moreover, women with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder generated longer narratives (t test results: t=2.30; p=.02) and used more negative emotional expressions (Wilcoxon test: sadness: p=8.90e-04; W=31,017; anger: p=1.32e-02; W=35,005.50) and death-related words (Wilcoxon test: p=3.48e-05; W=34,538) in describing their childbirth experience than those with no childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder.
CONCLUSION: This study provided proof of concept that personal childbirth narrative accounts generated in the early postpartum period and analyzed via advanced computational methods can detect with relatively high accuracy women who are likely to endorse childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder and those at low risk. This suggests that birth narratives could be promising for informing low-cost, noninvasive tools for maternal mental health screening, and more research that used machine learning to predict early signs of maternal psychiatric morbidity is warranted.","Identifying women with postdelivery posttraumatic stress disorder using natural language processing of personal childbirth narrativesBartal A, Jagodnik KM, Chan SJ, Babu MS, Dekel S.Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM. 2023 Mar;5(3):100834. doi: 10.1016/j.ajogmf.2022.100834.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study reviewed cases of IPV at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia from January 2016 to August 2019. The study sample was collected from electronic medical records by identifying IPV subjects using a natural language processing algorithm and then cross-referencing the trauma registry to identify patients who sustained head and neck injuries. The primary analyses of interest were to measure the association between gender and the following covariates: age, race, insurance status, setting of injury, day of injury, social history, report of physical abuse, mechanism of injury, injury location, brain injuries, soft tissue injuries, facial fractures, other associated injuries, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and discharge status. Univariate and bivariate analyses were calculated. Statistical significance was PÂ <Â .05.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty six patients met inclusion criteria. There were 120 (76.9%) female patients with a mean age of 34.5Â years (range, 16 to 67 years).

Women were statistically more likely than men to have government-subsidized insurance (47 [39.2%] vs 7 [19.4%]; PÂ =Â .03), positive alcohol exposure (27 [22.5%] vs 19 [52.8%]; PÂ =Â .0001), positive illicit drugs toxicology screen (25 [20.8%] vs 13 [36.1%]; P < .02), report physical abuse (24 [20%] vs 0; PÂ =Â .004), have subarachnoid hemorrhage (14 [11.7%] vs 0; PÂ =Â .04), and/or lower extremity injuries (39 [32.5%] vs 5 [13.9%]; PÂ =Â .03).
CONCLUSION: Males tend not to report physical abuse; this behavior contributes to IPV under-reporting in males.",True,1,computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

MedTaggerIE, an open-source NLP pipeline for information extraction based on text patterns, has been widely used in the annotation of clinical notes. A rule-based system, MedTagger-total hip arthroplasty (THA), developed based on MedTaggerIE, was previously shown to correctly identify the surgical approach, fixation, and bearing surface from the THA operative notes at Mayo Clinic.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the implementability, usability, and portability of MedTagger-THA at two external institutions, Michigan Medicine and the University of Iowa, and provide lessons learned for best practices.
METHODS: We conducted iterative test-apply-refinement processes with three involved sites-the development site (Mayo Clinic) and two deployment sites (Michigan Medicine and the University of Iowa). Mayo Clinic was the primary NLP development site, with the THA registry as the gold standard. The activities at the two deployment sites included the extraction of the operative notes, gold standard development (Michigan: registry data; Iowa: manual chart review), the refinement of NLP algorithms on training data, and the evaluation of test data. Error analyses were conducted to understand language variations across sites. To further assess the model specificity for approach and fixation, we applied the refined MedTagger-THA to arthroscopic hip procedures and periacetabular osteotomy cases, as neither of these operative notes should contain any approach or fixation keywords.
RESULTS: MedTagger-THA algorithms were implemented and refined independently for both sites. At Michigan, the study comprised THA-related notes for 2569 patient-date pairs. Before model refinement, MedTagger-THA algorithms demonstrated excellent accuracy for approach (96.6%, 95% CI 94.6%-97.9%) and fixation (95.7%, 95% CI 92.4%-97.6%). These results were comparable with internal accuracy at the development site (99.2% for approach and 90.7% for fixation). Model refinement improved accuracies slightly for both approach (99%, 95% CI 97.6%-99.6%) and fixation (98%, 95% CI 95.3%-99.3%). The specificity of approach identification was 88.9% for arthroscopy cases, and the specificity of fixation identification was 100% for both periacetabular osteotomy and arthroscopy cases. At the Iowa site, the study comprised an overall data set of 100 operative notes (50 training notes and 50 test notes). MedTagger-THA algorithms achieved moderate-high performance on the training data. After model refinement, the model achieved high performance for approach (100%, 95% CI 91.3%-100%), fixation (98%, 95% CI 88.3%-100%), and bearing surface (92%, 95% CI 80.5%-97.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: High performance across centers was achieved for the MedTagger-THA algorithms, demonstrating that they were sufficiently implementable, usable, and portable to different deployment sites. This study provided important lessons learned during the model deployment and validation processes, and it can serve as a reference for transferring rule-based electronic health record models.","Multicenter Validation of Natural Language Processing Algorithms for the Detection of Common Data Elements in Operative Notes for Total Hip Arthroplasty: Algorithm Development and ValidationHan P, Fu S, Kolis J, Hughes R, Hallstrom BR, Carvour M, Maradit-Kremers H, Sohn S, Vydiswaran VGV.JMIR Med Inform. 2022 Aug 31;10(8):e38155. doi: 10.2196/38155.BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) methods are powerful tools for extracting and analyzing critical information from free-text data.

Although assessing such risks is best done by health care professionals, people experiencing suicidal ideation may not seek help. Hence, machine learning (ML) and computational linguistics can provide analytical tools for understanding and analyzing risks. This, therefore, facilitates suicide intervention and prevention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore, using statistical analyses and ML, whether computerized language analysis could be applied to assess and better understand a person's suicide risk on social media.
METHODS: We used the University of Maryland Suicidality Dataset comprising text posts written by users (N=866) of mental health-related forums on Reddit. Each user was classified with a suicide risk rating (no, low, moderate, or severe) by either medical experts or crowdsourced annotators, denoting their estimated likelihood of dying by suicide. In language analysis, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon assessed sentiment, thinking styles, and part of speech, whereas readability was explored using the TextStat library. The Mann-Whitney U test identified differences between at-risk (low, moderate, and severe risk) and no-risk users. Meanwhile, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for granular analysis between risk levels and to identify redundancy, respectively. In the ML experiments, gradient boost, random forest, and support vector machine models were trained using 10-fold cross validation. The area under the receiver operator curve and F<sub>1</sub>-score were the primary measures. Finally, permutation importance uncovered the features that contributed the most to each model's decision-making.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P&lt;.05) were identified between the at-risk (671/866, 77.5%) and no-risk groups (195/866, 22.5%). This was true for both the crowd- and expert-annotated samples. Overall, at-risk users had higher median values for most variables (authenticity, first-person pronouns, and negation), with a notable exception of clout, which indicated that at-risk users were less likely to engage in social posturing. A high positive correlation (Ï&gt;0.84) was present between the part of speech variables, which implied redundancy and demonstrated the utility of aggregate features. All ML models performed similarly in their area under the curve (0.66-0.68); however, the random forest and gradient boost models were noticeably better in their F<sub>1</sub>-score (0.65 and 0.62) than the support vector machine (0.52). The features that contributed the most to the ML models were authenticity, clout, and negative emotions.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our statistical analyses found linguistic features associated with suicide risk, such as social posturing (eg, authenticity and clout), first-person singular pronouns, and negation. This increased our understanding of the behavioral and thought patterns of social media users and provided insights into the mechanisms behind ML models. We also demonstrated the applicative potential of ML in assisting health care professionals to assess and manage individuals experiencing suicide risk.","Analyzing Suicide Risk From Linguistic Features in Social Media: Evaluation StudyLao C, Lane J, Suominen H.JMIR Form Res. 2022 Aug 30;6(8):e35563. doi: 10.2196/35563.BACKGROUND: Effective suicide risk assessments and interventions are vital for suicide prevention.

The previous largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified SNCA and TMEM175 loci on chromosome (Chr) 4 with a significant influence on the AAO of PD; these have not been independently replicated. This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS of PD AAO and validate previously observed findings in worldwide populations.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on PD AAO GWAS of 30 populations of predominantly European ancestry from the Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease (COURAGE-PD) Consortium. This was followed by combining our study with the largest publicly available European ancestry dataset compiled by the International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC).
RESULTS: The COURAGE-PD Consortium included a cohort of 8,535 patients with PD (91.9%: Europeans and 9.1%: East Asians). The average AAO in the COURAGE-PD dataset was 58.9 years (SD = 11.6), with an underrepresentation of females (40.2%). The heritability estimate for AAO in COURAGE-PD was 0.083 (SE = 0.057). None of the loci reached genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5 Ã 10-8). Nevertheless, the COURAGE-PD dataset confirmed the role of the previously published TMEM175 variant as a genetic determinant of the AAO of PD with Bonferroni-corrected nominal levels of significance (p &lt; 0.025): (rs34311866: Î²(SE)<sub>COURAGE</sub> = 0.477(0.203), p <sub>COURAGE</sub> = 0.0185). The subsequent meta-analysis of COURAGE-PD and IPDGC datasets (N<sub>total</sub> = 25,950) led to the identification of 2 genome-wide significant association signals on Chr 4, including the previously reported SNCA locus (rs983361: Î²(SE)<sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = 0.720(0.122), p <sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = 3.13 Ã 10-9) and a novel BST1 locus (rs4698412: Î²(SE)<sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = -0.526(0.096), p <sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = 4.41 Ã 10-8).
DISCUSSION: Our study further refines the genetic architecture of Chr 4 underlying the AAO of the PD phenotype through the identification of BST1 as a novel AAO PD locus.

Word extraction from the text mining method set out the following guiding axioms from the bigrams: ""confronting syphilis in primary health care;"" ""investigation committee for congenital syphilis in the territory;"" ""municipal plan for monitoring and investigating syphilis cases through health surveillance;"" ""women's healthcare networks for syphilis in pregnant;"" ""diagnosis and treatment with a focus on rapid testing."" Text mining may serve public health research subjects when used in parallel with the conventional content analysis method. The computational method extracted intervention activities from field researchers, also providing inferences on how the strategies of the ""Syphilis No"" Project influenced the decrease in congenital syphilis cases in the territory.",True,3,other,"['language processing', 'text mining', 'language processing']"

Epub 2021 Nov 9.,Gordon AJ,Am J Emerg Med,2022,2021/11/28,,,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.11.001,"BACKGROUND: The Mortality Probability Model (MPM) is used in research and quality improvement to adjust for severity of illness and can also inform triage decisions. However, a limitation for its automated use or application is that it includes the variable ""intracranial mass effect"" (IME), which requires human engagement with the electronic health record (EHR). We developed and tested a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify IME from CT head reports.
METHODS: We obtained initial CT head reports from adult patients who were admitted to the ICU from our ED between 10/2013 and 9/2016. Each head CT head report was labeled yes/no IME by at least two of five independent labelers. The reports were then randomly divided 80/20 into training and test sets. All reports were preprocessed to remove linguistic and style variability, and a dictionary was created to map similar common terms. We tested three vectorization strategies: Term Frequency-Inverse Document frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Universal Sentence Encoder to convert the report text to a numerical vector. This vector served as the input to a classification-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm (XGBoost). After training, model performance was assessed in the test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We also divided the continuous range of scores into positive/inconclusive/negative categories for IME.
RESULTS: Of the 1202 CT reports in the training set, 308 (25.6%) reports were manually labeled as ""yes"" for IME. Of the 355 reports in the test set, 108 (30.4%) were labeled as ""yes"" for IME. The TF-IDF vectorization strategy as an input for the XGBoost model had the best AUROC:-- 0.9625 (95% CI 0.9443-0.9807). TF-IDF score categories were defined and had the following likelihood ratios: ""positive"" (TF-IDF scoreÂ >Â 0.5) LRÂ =Â 24.59; ""inconclusive"" (TF-IDF 0.05-0.5) LRÂ =Â 0.99; and ""negative"" (TF-IDFÂ <Â 0.05) LRÂ =Â 0.05. 82% of reports were classified as either ""positive"" or ""negative"". In the test set, only 4 of 199 (2.0%) reports with a ""negative"" classification were false negatives and only 8 of 93 (8.6%) reports classified as ""positive"" were false positives.
CONCLUSION: NLP can accurately identify IME from free-text reports of head CTs in approximately 80% of records, adequate to allow automatic calculation of MPM based on EHR data for many applications.","Natural language processing of head CT reports to identify intracranial mass effect: CTIME algorithmGordon AJ, Banerjee I, Block J, Winstead-Derlega C, Wilson JG, Mitarai T, Jarrett M, Sanyal J, Rubin DL, Wintermark M, Kohn MA.Am J Emerg Med. 2022 Jan;51:388-392. doi: 10.1016/j.ajem.2021.11.001.

Part of the Australian response was a robust primary care approach, involving changes to care models (including telehealth) and the widespread use of data to inform the changes. This paper outlines how a large primary care database responded to provide real-time data to inform policy and practice. Simply extracting the data is not sufficient. Understanding the data is. The POpulation Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) program is designed to use GP data for multiple objectives and is built on a pre-existing engagement framework established over a fifteen-year period. Initially developed to provide QA activities for general practices and population level data for General Practice support organisations, the POLAR platform has demonstrated the critical ability to design and deploy real-time data analytics solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic for a variety of stakeholders including state and federal government agencies.
METHODS: The system extracts and processes data from over 1,300 general practices daily. Data is de-identified at the point of collection and encrypted before transfer. Data cleaning for analysis uses a variety of techniques, including Natural Language Processing and coding of free text information. The curated dataset is then distilled into several analytic solutions designed to address specific areas of investigation of interest to various stakeholders. One such analytic solution was a model we created that used multiple data inputs to rank patient geographic areas by the likelihood of a COVID-19 outbreak. The model utilised pathology ordering, COVID-19 related diagnoses, indication of COVID-19 related concern (via progress notes) and also incorporated state based actual confirmed case figures.
RESULTS: Using the methods described, we were able to deliver real-time data feeds to practices, Primary Health Networks (PHN) and other agencies. In addition, we developed a COVID-19 geographic risk stratification based on local government areas (LGAs) to pro-actively inform the primary care response. Providing PHNs with a list of geographic priority hotspots allowed for better targeting and response of Personal Protective Equipment allocation and pop-up clinic placement.

Because manual review of medical records is labor intensive, a survival analysis using a large patient cohort with comprehensive clinical and histopathologic characteristics is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic significance of TILs among patients with cutaneous melanoma using a large cohort established through natural language processing (NLP) algorithms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the medical records of 14â¯436 patients with cutaneous melanoma at Brigham and Women's Hospital between June 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019. Patients were followed up to death or censored at their last clinical visit.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 14â¯436 patients with cutaneous melanoma were identified in the institution's pathology information system. Using NLP, we established a study cohort of 2624 patients (1462 men [55.7%]; median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 50-72 years]) who had vertical growth phase melanoma with TIL status scored. Absent TILs were identified in 434 patients (16.5%), nonbrisk TILs in 1916 patients (73.0%), and brisk TILs in 274 patients (10.4%). The 5-year survival rate was 71.0% (95% CI, 65.5%-76.9%) among patients with an absence of TILs, 73.8% (95% CI, 71.1%-76.5%) among patients with nonbrisk TILs, and 85.2% (95% CI, 80.0%-90.7%) among patients with brisk TILs. Brisk TILs were significantly associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; Pâ=â.03; 14.2% OS advantage at 5 years), and nonbrisk TILs were not associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.68-1.11; Pâ=â.25), compared with the absence of TILs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides evidence based on a large patient cohort from a single institution that suggests that brisk TILs represent an independent prognostic factor for OS among patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. The study also suggests that NLP is a highly efficient tool to facilitate large-scale analyses that involve free-text clinical data.","Assessing the Prognostic Significance of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Patients With Melanoma Using Pathologic Features Identified by Natural Language ProcessingYang J, Lian JW, Chin YH, Wang L, Lian A, Murphy GF, Zhou L.JAMA Netw Open. 2021 Sep 1;4(9):e2126337. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.26337.IMPORTANCE: Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are an important histopathologic characteristic reflecting host immune response in patients with melanoma, their prognostic value remains controversial.

Further evaluation of free-text reports is difficult to achieve without a great deal of manual effort, and is not possible in everyday clinical practice. This study aims to automatically capture clinical information and positive hit rates from narrative radiological reports of suspected urolithiasis using natural language processing (NLP).
METHODS: Narrative reports of low dose computed tomography (CT) of the retroperitoneum from April 2016 to July 2018 (n = 1714) were analyzed using NLP. These free-text reports were automatically structured based on RadLex concepts. Manual feedback was used to test and train the NLP engine to further enhance the performance. The chi-squared test, phi coefficient, and logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the effect of clinical information on the positive hit rate of urolithiasis.
RESULTS: Urolithiasis was affirmed in 72 % of the reports; in 38 % at least one stone was described in the kidneys, and in 45 % at least one stone was described in the ureter. Clinical information, such as previous stone history and obstructive uropathy, showed a strong correlation with confirmed urolithiasis (p = 0.001). Previous stone history and the combination of obstructive uropathy and loin pain had the highest association with positive urolithiasis (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Applying this NLP approach to already existing free-text reports allows the conversion of such reports into a structured form. This may be valuable for epidemiological studies, to evaluate the appropriateness of CT examinations, or to answer a variety of research questions.","Towards data-driven medical imaging using natural language processing in patients with suspected urolithiasisJungmann F, KÃ¤mpgen B, Mildenberger P, Tsaur I, Jorg T, DÃ¼ber C, Mildenberger P, Kloeckner R.Int J Med Inform. 2020 May;137:104106. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104106.

Report No.: 19(20)-EHC026-EF.,Gartlehner G,Assessing the Accuracy of Machine-Assisted Abstract Screening With DistillerAI: A User Study,2019,2019/11/01,,,,"BACKGROUND: Web applications that employ natural language processing technologies such as text mining and text classification to support systematic reviewers during abstract screening have become more user friendly and more common. Such semi-automated screening tools can increase efficiency by reducing the number of abstracts needed to screen or by replacing one screener after adequately training the algorithm of the machine. Savings in workload between 30 percent and 70 percent might be possible with the use of such tools. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool.
METHODS: To address our objective, we evaluated the accuracy of a machine-assisted screening approach using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review as the reference standard. We chose DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool for our project, applying its naÃ¯ve Bayesian machine-learning option. Five teams screened the same 2,472 abstracts in parallel, using the machine-assisted approach. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For the remaining 2,172 abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener in each team and provided predictions about the relevance of records. We used a prediction score of 0.5 (i.e., inconclusive) or greater to classify a record as an inclusion. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening (i.e., no machine assistance), and screening with DistillerAI alone (i.e., no human involvement after training) against the reference standard and calculated sensitivities, specificities, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. In addition, we determined the interrater agreement, the proportion of included abstracts, and the number of conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI.
RESULTS: The mean sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 66% to 90%), and the mean specificity was 95 percent (95% CI, 92% to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was also 78 percent (95% CI, 66% to 89%); the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was 14 percent (95% CI, 0% to 31%). Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI alone were 94 percent (95% CI, 91% to 97%) and 98 percent (95% CI, 97% to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86).
DISCUSSION: Findings of our study indicate that the accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening. The approach that we tested missed too many relevant studies and created too many conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews.","Assessing the Accuracy of Machine-Assisted Abstract Screening With DistillerAI: A User StudyGartlehner G, Wagner G, Lux L, Affengruber L, Dobrescu A, Kaminski-Hartenthaler A, Viswanathan M.Rockville (MD): Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2019 Nov.

Using data on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; nÂ =Â 49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (Ï) coefficients (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this large sample, effect sizes were mostly ""very small"" (conventionally defined as Ï or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: meanregular usersÂ =Â 19 vs. meannonregular usersÂ =Â 19 (dÂ =Â -0.03); physical activity: meanregular usersÂ =Â 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week vs. meannonregular usersÂ =Â 24 MET-hours/week (dÂ =Â 0.01)).

Using data on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; nÂ =Â 49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (Ï) coefficients (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this large sample, effect sizes were mostly ""very small"" (conventionally defined as Ï or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: meanregular usersÂ =Â 19 vs. meannonregular usersÂ =Â 19 (dÂ =Â -0.03); physical activity: meanregular usersÂ =Â 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week vs. meannonregular usersÂ =Â 24 MET-hours/week (dÂ =Â 0.01)). Some factors had slightly larger differences for regular users versus nonregular users (e.g., depression: 28% vs. 23% (ÏÂ =Â 0.05); odds ratioÂ =Â 1.27 (95% confidence interval:Â 1.22, 1.33); obesity: 34% vs. 26% (Ï =Â 0.07); odds ratioÂ =Â 1.42 (95% confidence interval:Â 1.36, 1.48)). Results suggest that regular Facebook users were similar to nonregular users across sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with modestly worse health regarding obesity and depressive symptoms.

Recent federal initiatives promote the use of RWD to make clinical assertions that influence regulatory decision-making. Our objective was to determine whether traditional real world evidence (RWE) techniques in cardiovascular medicine achieve accuracy sufficient for credible clinical assertions, also known as ""regulatory-grade"" RWE.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic health records (EHR), 2010-2016.
METHODS: A predefined set of clinical concepts was extracted from EHR structured (EHR-S) and unstructured (EHR-U) data using traditional query techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, respectively. Performance was evaluated against manually annotated cohorts using standard metrics. Accuracy was compared to pre-defined criteria for regulatory-grade. Differences in accuracy were compared using Chi-square test.
RESULTS: The dataset included 10 840 clinical notes. Individual concept occurrence ranged from 194 for coronary artery bypass graft to 4502 for diabetes mellitus. In EHR-S, average recall and precision were 51.7% and 98.3%, respectively and 95.5% and 95.3% in EHR-U, respectively. For each clinical concept, EHR-S accuracy was below regulatory-grade, while EHR-U met or exceeded criteria, with the exception of medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying an appropriate RWE approach is dependent on cohorts studied and accuracy required. In this study, recall varied greatly between EHR-S and EHR-U. Overall, EHR-S did not meet regulatory grade criteria, while EHR-U did. These results suggest that recall should be routinely measured in EHR-based studes intended for regulatory use. Furthermore, advanced data and technologies may be required to achieve regulatory grade results.","Real world evidence in cardiovascular medicine: ensuring data validity in electronic health record-based studiesHernandez-Boussard T, Monda KL, Crespo BC, Riskin D.J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2019 Nov 1;26(11):1189-1194. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocz119.OBJECTIVE: With growing availability of digital health data and technology, health-related studies are increasingly augmented or implemented using real world data (RWD).

This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content.
METHODS: We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care.
RESULTS: Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.","A Virtual Agent to Support Individuals Living With Physical and Mental Comorbidities: Co-Design and Acceptability TestingEaston K, Potter S, Bec R, Bennion M, Christensen H, Grindell C, Mirheidari B, Weich S, de Witte L, Wolstenholme D, Hawley MS.J Med Internet Res. 2019 May 30;21(5):e12996. doi: 10.2196/12996.BACKGROUND: Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems.

However, there is a gap in how often providers counsel patients about SUDEP. One potential solution is to electronically prompt clinicians to provide counseling via automated detection of risk factors in electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated (1) the feasibility and generalizability of using regular expressions to identify risk factors in EMRs and (2) barriers to generalizability.
METHODS: Data included physician notes for 3000 patients from one medical center (home) and 1000 from five additional centers (away). Through chart review, we identified three SUDEP risk factors: (1) generalized tonic-clonic seizures, (2) refractory epilepsy, and (3) epilepsy surgery candidacy. Regular expressions of risk factors were manually created with home training data, and performance was evaluated with home test and away test data. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F-measure. Generalizability was defined as an absolute decrease in performance by <0.10 for away versus home test data. To evaluate underlying barriers to generalizability, we identified causes of errors seen more often in away data than home data. To demonstrate how small revisions can improve generalizability, we removed three ""boilerplate"" standard text phrases from away notes and repeated performance.
RESULTS: We observed high performance in home test data (F-measure range = 0.86-0.90), and low to high performance in away test data (F-measure range = 0.53-0.81). After removing three boilerplate phrases, away performance improved (F-measure range = 0.79-0.89) and generalizability was achieved for nearly all measures. The only significant barrier to generalizability was use of boilerplate phrases, causing 104 of 171 errors (61%) in away data.
SIGNIFICANCE: Regular expressions are a feasible and probably a generalizable method to identify variables related to SUDEP risk.

Whether capturing more of the available data and applying machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can improve and automate the prediction of outcomes among patients in the ICU remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the change in power for a mortality prediction model among patients in the ICU achieved by incorporating measures of clinical trajectory together with NLP of clinical text and to assess the generalizability of this approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 101â¯196 patients with a first-time admission to the ICU and a length of stay of at least 4 hours. Twenty ICUs at 2 academic medical centers (University of California, San Francisco [UCSF], and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC], Boston, Massachusetts) and 1 community hospital (Mills-Peninsula Medical Center [MPMC], Burlingame, California) contributed data from January 1, 2001, through June 1, 2017. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, through August 1, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and model discrimination as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and model calibration as assessed by the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.
RESULTS: Among 101â¯196 patients included in the analysis, 51.3% (nâ=â51â¯899) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (17.1) years; their in-hospital mortality rate was 10.4% (nâ=â10â¯505). A baseline model using only the highest and lowest observed values for each laboratory test result or vital sign achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.830-0.832). In contrast, that model augmented with measures of clinical trajectory achieved an AUC of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902; Pâ<â.001 for AUC difference). Further augmenting this model with NLP-derived terms associated with mortality further increased the AUC to 0.922 (95% CI, 0.916-0.924; Pâ<â.001). These NLP-derived terms were associated with improved model performance even when applied across sites (AUC difference for UCSF: 0.077 to 0.021; AUC difference for MPMC: 0.071 to 0.051; AUC difference for BIDMC: 0.035 to 0.043; Pâ<â.001) when augmenting with NLP at each site.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive care unit mortality prediction models incorporating measures of clinical trajectory and NLP-derived terms yielded excellent predictive performance and generalized well in this sample of hospitals. The role of these automated algorithms, particularly those using unstructured data from notes and other sources, in clinical research and quality improvement seems to merit additional investigation.","Validation of Prediction Models for Critical Care Outcomes Using Natural Language Processing of Electronic Health Record DataMarafino BJ, Park M, Davies JM, Thombley R, Luft HS, Sing DC, Kazi DS, DeJong C, Boscardin WJ, Dean ML, Dudley RA.JAMA Netw Open. 2018 Dec 7;1(8):e185097. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.5097.IMPORTANCE: Accurate prediction of outcomes among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is important for clinical research and monitoring care quality. Most existing prediction models do not take full advantage of the electronic health record, using only the single worst value of laboratory tests and vital signs and largely ignoring information present in free-text notes. Whether capturing more of the available data and applying machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can improve and automate the prediction of outcomes among patients in the ICU remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the change in power for a mortality prediction model among patients in the ICU achieved by incorporating measures of clinical trajectory together with NLP of clinical text and to assess the generalizability of this approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 101â¯196 patients with a first-time admission to the ICU and a length of stay of at least 4 hours. Twenty ICUs at 2 academic medical centers (University of California, San Francisco [UCSF], and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC], Boston, Massachusetts) and 1 community hospital (Mills-Peninsula Medical Center [MPMC], Burlingame, California) contributed data from January 1, 2001, through June 1, 2017. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, through August 1, 2018.

Electronic health records (EHRs) impose an inefficient search process where infection preventionists must manually review every postsurgical encounter (< 30 days). Using text mining and business intelligence software, we developed an information foraging application, the SSI Workbench, to visually present which postsurgical encounters included SSI-related terms and synonyms, antibiotic, and culture orders.
OBJECTIVE: This article compares the Workbench and EHR on four dimensions: (1) effectiveness, (2) efficiency, (3) workload, and (4) usability.
METHODS: Comparative usability test of Workbench and EHR. Objective test metrics are time per case, encounters reviewed per case, time per encounter, and retrieval of information meeting NHSN definitions. Subjective measures are cognitive load using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and a questionnaire on system usability and utility.
RESULTS: Eight infection preventionists participated in the test. There was no difference in effectiveness as subjects retrieved information from all cases, using both systems, to meet the NHSN criteria. There was no difference in efficiency in time per case between the Workbench and EHR (8.58 vs. 7.39 minutes, pâ=â0.36). However, with the Workbench subjects opened fewer encounters per case (3.0 vs. 7.5, pâ=â0.002), spent more time per encounter (2.23 vs. 0.92 minutes, pâ=â0.002), rated the Workbench lower in cognitive load (NASA TLX, 24 vs. 33, pâ=â0.02), and significantly higher in measures of usability.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the EHR, the Workbench was more usable, short, and reduced cognitive load. In overall efficiency, the Workbench did not save time, but demonstrated a shift from between-encounter foraging to within-encounter foraging and was rated as significantly more efficient. Our results suggest that infection surveillance can be better supported by systems applying information foraging theory.","User Testing an Information Foraging Tool for Ambulatory Surgical Site Infection SurveillanceKaravite DJ, Miller MW, Ramos MJ, Rettig SL, Ross RK, Xiao R, Muthu N, Localio AR, Gerber JS, Coffin SE, Grundmeier RW.Appl Clin Inform. 2018 Oct;9(4):791-802. doi: 10.1055/s-0038-1675179.

To electronically harness these records, they need to be transformed into codified fields by natural language processing algorithms.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop, train, and validate Clinical History Extractor for Syndromic Surveillance (CHESS), an natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical information from free-text primary care records.
METHODS: CHESS is a keyword-based natural language processing algorithm to extract 48 signs and symptoms suggesting respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, constitutional, as well as other signs and symptoms potentially associated with infectious diseases. The algorithm also captured the assertion status (affirmed, negated, or suspected) and symptom duration. Electronic medical records from the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics, a major public sector primary care provider in Singapore, were randomly extracted and manually reviewed by 2 human reviewers, with a third reviewer as the adjudicator. The algorithm was evaluated based on 1680 notes against the human-coded result as the reference standard, with half of the data used for training and the other half for validation.
RESULTS: The symptoms most commonly present within the 1680 clinical records at the episode level were those typically present in respiratory infections such as cough (744/7703, 9.66%), sore throat (591/7703, 7.67%), rhinorrhea (552/7703, 7.17%), and fever (928/7703, 12.04%). At the episode level, CHESS had an overall performance of 96.7% precision and 97.6% recall on the training dataset and 96.0% precision and 93.1% recall on the validation dataset. Symptoms suggesting respiratory and gastrointestinal infections were all detected with more than 90% precision and recall. CHESS correctly assigned the assertion status in 97.3%, 97.9%, and 89.8% of affirmed, negated, and suspected signs and symptoms, respectively (97.6% overall accuracy). Symptom episode duration was correctly identified in 81.2% of records with known duration status.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an natural language processing algorithm dubbed CHESS that achieves good performance in extracting signs and symptoms from primary care free-text clinical records.

To improve accessibility for clinicians, the originators of the standard deliberately designed Arden Syntax expressions to resemble natural language, and parentheses around operands are not generally required. For certain patterns of nested expressions, however, the use of parentheses is mandatory, otherwise they are not accepted by an Arden Syntax environment. In this study, we refer to such patterns as anomalies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent and the circumstances of such anomalies, and to outline a solution based on an alternative grammar encoding approach.
METHODS: To analyze the distribution of anomalies in nested expressions, we developed two custom-made complementary utilities. The first utility, termed parser, checks a single expression pattern against the specification-compliant grammar for syntactic correctness. The second utility, termed composer, automatically creates an extensive amount of expression patterns by permuting and nesting operators without the use of parentheses, and stores these together with the expected syntactic correctness. By means of these utilities we conducted a comprehensive analysis of anomalies by comparing the expected correctness with the actual correctness. Any detected anomalies are stored into a set of files, grouped by the respective top-level operator, for a subsequent analysis.
RESULTS: The composer utility nested 165 unary, binary, or ternary operators of Arden Syntax version 2.8 to a depth of two, resulting in a set of 76,533 expression patterns, of which 18,978 (24.8%) have been identified as anomalies. An automated assessment of their practical relevance for medical knowledge encoding is infeasible. Manual screening of selected samples indicated that only a small proportion of the detected anomalies would be relevant. The cause of the anomalies lies in the encoding of the grammar. A change of the basic encoding approach with some additional customizations eliminates the anomalies. A working expression parser is included in the supplementary material.
CONCLUSION: Arden Syntax expressions are affected by anomalies. Since only a small proportion of them have practical relevance and they cannot cause false calculations or clinical decisions, their practical impact is likely limited. However, they may be potential points of confusion for knowledge engineers. An alternative expression grammar, based on a different encoding approach, would not only eliminate the anomalies, but could considerably facilitate both maintenance and further development of the standard.","A detailed analysis of the Arden Syntax expression grammarKraus S, Rosenbauer M, SchrÃ¶der L, BÃ¼rkle T, Adlassnig KP, Toddenroth D.J Biomed Inform. 2018 Jul;83:196-203. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2018.05.008.

EHR systems facilitate the collection of this secondary use data, which can be used for research purposes like observational studies, taking advantage of improvement in the structuring and retrieval of patient information. However, some of the following problems are common when conducting a research using this kind of data: (i) Over time, systems and data storage methods become obsolete; (ii) Data concerns arise since the data is being used in a context removed from its original intention; (iii) There are privacy concerns when sharing data about individual subjects; (iv) The partial availability of standard medical vocabularies and natural language processing tools for non-English language limits information extraction from structured and unstructured data in the EHR systems. A systematic approach is therefore needed to overcome these, where local data processing is performed prior to data sharing.
METHOD: The proposed study describes a local processing method to extract cohorts of patients for observational studies in four steps: (1) data reorganization from an existing local logical schema into a common external schema over which information can be extracted; (2) cleaning of data, generation of the database profile and retrieval of indicators; (3) computation of derived variables from original variables; (4) application of study design parameters to transform longitudinal data into anonymized data sets ready for statistical analysis and sharing. Mapping from the local logical schema into a common external schema must be performed differently for each EHR and is not subject of this work, but step 2, 3 and 4 are common to all EHRs. The external schema accepts parameters that facilitate the extraction of different cohorts for different studies without having to change the extraction algorithms, and ensures that, given an immutable data set, can be done by the idempotent process. Statistical analysis is part of the process to generate the results necessary for inclusion in reports. The generation of indicators to describe the database allows description of its characteristics, highlighting study results. The set extraction/statistical processing is available in a version controlled repository and can be used at any time to reproduce results, allowing the verification of alterations and error corrections. This methodology promotes the development of reproducible studies and allows potential research problems to be tracked upon extraction algorithms and statistical methods RESULTS: This method was applied to an admissions database, SI3, from the InCor-HCFMUSP, a tertiary referral hospital for cardiovascular disease in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, as a source of secondary data with 1116848 patients records from 1999 up to 2013. The cleaning process resulted in 313894 patients records and 27698 patients in the cohort selection, with the following criteria: study period: 2003-2013, gender: Male, Female, age:â¥18years old, at least 2 outpatient encounters, diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (ICD-10 codes: I20-I25, I64-I70 and G45). An R script provided descriptive statistics of the extracted cohort.
CONCLUSION: This method guarantees a reproducible cohort extraction for use of secondary data in observational studies with enough parameterization to support different study designs and can be used on diverse data sources. Moreover it allows observational electronic health record cohort research to be performed in a non-English language with limited international recognized medical vocabulary.","A method for cohort selection of cardiovascular disease records from an electronic health record systemAbrahÃ£o MTF, Nobre MRC, Gutierrez MA.Int J Med Inform. 2017 Jun;102:138-149. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.03.015.

Although the highest quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, hemochromatosis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database (UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets (disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships.","Text Mining Genotype-Phenotype Relationships from Biomedical Literature for Database Curation and Precision MedicineSinghal A, Simmons M, Lu Z.PLoS Comput Biol. 2016 Nov 30;12(11):e1005017. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005017. eCollection 2016 Nov.The practice of precision medicine will ultimately require databases of genes and mutations for healthcare providers to reference in order to understand the clinical implications of each patient's genetic makeup.

One-third of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease. This study will establish the relationship of SMI with cardiovascular disease in ethnic minority groups (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean, black African and Irish), in the UK.
METHODS: E-CHASM is a mixed methods study utilising data from 1.25 million electronic patient records. Secondary analysis of routine patient records will establish if differences in cause-specific mortality, cardiovascular disease prevalence and disparities in accessing healthcare for ethnic minority people living with SMI exist. A nested qualitative study will be used to assess barriers to accessing healthcare, both from the perspectives of service users and providers.
RESULTS: In primary care, 993,116 individuals, aged 18+, provided data from 186/189 (98 %) practices in four inner-city boroughs (local government areas) in London. Prevalence of SMI according to primary care records, ranged from 1.3-1.7 %, across boroughs. The primary care sample included Bangladeshi [n = 94,643 (10 %)], Indian [n = 6086 (6 %)], Pakistani [n = 35,596 (4 %)], black Caribbean [n = 45,013 (5 %)], black African [n = 75,454 (8 %)] and Irish people [n = 13,745 (1 %)].

Epub 2015 Feb 5.,Cohen AM,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2015,2015/02/07,PMC4457112,,10.1093/jamia/ocu025,"OBJECTIVE: For many literature review tasks, including systematic review (SR) and other aspects of evidence-based medicine, it is important to know whether an article describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Current manual annotation is not complete or flexible enough for the SR process. In this work, highly accurate machine learning predictive models were built that include confidence predictions of whether an article is an RCT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LibSVM classifier was used with forward selection of potential feature sets on a large human-related subset of MEDLINE to create a classification model requiring only the citation, abstract, and MeSH terms for each article.
RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.973 and mean squared error of 0.013 on the held out year 2011 data. Accurate confidence estimates were confirmed on a manually reviewed set of test articles. A second model not requiring MeSH terms was also created, and performs almost as well.
DISCUSSION: Both models accurately rank and predict article RCT confidence. Using the model and the manually reviewed samples, it is estimated that about 8000 (3%) additional RCTs can be identified in MEDLINE, and that 5% of articles tagged as RCTs in Medline may not be identified.
CONCLUSION: Retagging human-related studies with a continuously valued RCT confidence is potentially more useful for article ranking and review than a simple yes/no prediction. The automated RCT tagging tool should offer significant savings of time and effort during the process of writing SRs, and is a key component of a multistep text mining pipeline that we are building to streamline SR workflow.

Identification of genetic variants that influence the rate of cognitive decline or pattern of early cognitive deficits in PD might provide a clearer understanding of the etiopathogenesis of this important nonmotor feature.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether common variation in the APOE, MAPT, and SNCA genes is associated with cognitive performance in patients with PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 1079 PD patients from 6 academic centers in the United States who underwent assessments of memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R]), attention and executive function (Letter-Number Sequencing Test and Trail Making Test), language processing (semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tests), visuospatial skills (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test), and global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Participants underwent genotyping for the APOE Îµ2/Îµ3/Îµ4 alleles, MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes, and SNCA rs356219. We used linear regression to test for association between genotype and baseline cognitive performance with adjustment for age, sex, years of education, disease duration, and site. We used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the 9 comparisons that were performed for each gene.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nine variables derived from 7 psychometric tests.
RESULTS: The APOE Îµ4 allele was associated with lower performance on the HVLT-R Total Recall (P = 6.7 Ã 10(-6); corrected P [Pc]â= 6.0 Ã 10(-5)), Delayed Recall (P =â.001; Pc =â.009), and Recognition Discrimination Index (P =â.004; Pc =â.04); a semantic verbal fluency test (P =â.002; Pc =â.02); the Letter-Number Sequencing Test (P = 1 Ã 10(-5); Pc = 9 Ã 10(-5)); and Trail Making Test B minus Trail Making Test A (P =â.002; Pc =â.02). In a subset of 645 patients without dementia, the APOE Îµ4 allele was associated with lower scores on the HVLT-R Total Recall (P =â.005; Pc =â.045) and the semantic verbal fluency (P =â.005; Pc =â.045) measures. Variants of MAPT and SNCA were not associated with scores on any tests.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our data indicate that the APOE Îµ4 allele is an important predictor of cognitive function in PD across multiple domains. Among PD patients without dementia, the APOE Îµ4 allele was only associated with lower performance on word list learning and semantic verbal fluency, a pattern more typical of the cognitive deficits seen in early Alzheimer disease than PD.","APOE, MAPT, and SNCA genes and cognitive performance in Parkinson diseaseMata IF, Leverenz JB, Weintraub D, Trojanowski JQ, Hurtig HI, Van Deerlin VM, Ritz B, Rausch R, Rhodes SL, Factor SA, Wood-Siverio C, Quinn JF, Chung KA, Peterson AL, Espay AJ, Revilla FJ, Devoto J, Hu SC, Cholerton BA, Wan JY, Montine TJ, Edwards KL, Zabetian CP.JAMA Neurol. 2014 Nov;71(11):1405-12. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.1455.IMPORTANCE: Cognitive impairment is a common and disabling problem in Parkinson disease (PD) that is not well understood and is difficult to treat. Identification of genetic variants that influence the rate of cognitive decline or pattern of early cognitive deficits in PD might provide a clearer understanding of the etiopathogenesis of this important nonmotor feature.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether common variation in the APOE, MAPT, and SNCA genes is associated with cognitive performance in patients with PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 1079 PD patients from 6 academic centers in the United States who underwent assessments of memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R]), attention and executive function (Letter-Number Sequencing Test and Trail Making Test), language processing (semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tests), visuospatial skills (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test), and global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Participants underwent genotyping for the APOE Îµ2/Îµ3/Îµ4 alleles, MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes, and SNCA rs356219. We used linear regression to test for association between genotype and baseline cognitive performance with adjustment for age, sex, years of education, disease duration, and site.

Machine learning may support radiologists reading whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.
OBJECTIVES: 1. To develop a machine-learning algorithm to detect normal organs and cancer lesions. 2. To compare diagnostic accuracy, time and agreement of radiology reads to detect metastases using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging with concurrent machine learning (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) against standard whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation).
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of (1) prospective single-centre study in healthy volunteersâ&gt;â18 years (nâ=â51) and (2) prospective multicentre STREAMLINE study patient data (nâ=â438).
TESTS: Index: whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning. Comparator: whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation.
REFERENCE STANDARD: Previously established expert panel consensus reference at 12 months from diagnosis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: difference in per-patient specificity between whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning and whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation. Secondary: per-patient sensitivity, per-lesion sensitivity and specificity, read time and agreement.
METHODS: Phase 1: classification forests, convolutional neural networks, and a multi-atlas approaches for organ segmentation. Phase 2/3: whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scans were allocated to Phase 2 (trainingâ=â226, validationâ=â45) and Phase 3 (testingâ=â193). Disease sites were manually labelled. The final algorithm was applied to 193 Phase 3 cases, generating probability heatmaps. Twenty-five radiologists (18 experienced, 7 inexperienced in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging) were randomly allocated whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning or whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation over two or three rounds in a National Health Service setting. Read time was independently recorded.
RESULTS: Phases 1 and 2: convolutional neural network had best Dice similarity coefficient, recall and precision measurements for healthy organ segmentation. Final algorithm used a âtwo-stageâ initial organ identification followed by lesion detection. Phase 3: evaluable scans (188/193, of which 50 had metastases from 117 colon, 71 lung cancer cases) were read between November 2019 and March 2020. For experienced readers, per-patient specificity for detection of metastases was 86.2% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and 87.7% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation), (difference â1.5%, 95% confidence interval â6.4% to 3.5%; pâ=â0.387); per-patient sensitivity was 66.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and 70.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation) (difference â4.0%, 95% confidence interval â13.5% to 5.5%; pâ=â0.344). For inexperienced readers (53 reads, 15 with metastases), per-patient specificity was 76.3% in both groups with sensitivities of 73.3% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and 60.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation). Per-site specificity remained high within all sites; above 95% (experienced) or 90% (inexperienced). Per-site sensitivity was highly variable due to low number of lesions in each site. Reading time lowered under machine learning by 6.2% (95% confidence interval â22.8% to 10.0%). Read time was primarily influenced by read round with round 2 read times reduced by 32% (95% confidence interval 20.8% to 42.8%) overall with subsequent regression analysis showing a significant effect (pâ=â0.0281) by using machine learning in round 2 estimated as 286 seconds (or 11%) quicker. Interobserver variance for experienced readers suggests moderate agreement, Cohenâs Îºâ=â0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.81 (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and Cohenâs Îºâ=â0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.81 (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation).
LIMITATIONS: Patient whole-body magnetic resonance imaging data were heterogeneous with relatively few metastatic lesions in a wide variety of locations, making training and testing difficult and hampering evaluation of sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy for whole-body magnetic resonance imaging radiology reads with or without machine-learning support, although radiology read time may be slightly shortened using whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning.

To test novel interventions, personalized risk prediction is essential. The ORBI (Observatoire RÃ©gional Breton sur l'Infarctus) score represents the first-of-its-kind risk score to predict in-hospital CS in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, its sex-specific performance remains unknown, and refined risk prediction strategies are warranted.
METHODS: This multinational study included a total of 53â537 ACS patients without CS on admission undergoing PCI. Following sex-specific evaluation of ORBI, regression and machine-learning models were used for variable selection and risk prediction. By combining best-performing models with highest-ranked predictors, SEX-SHOCK was developed, and internally and externally validated.
RESULTS: The ORBI score showed lower discriminative performance for the prediction of CS in females than males in Swiss (AUC [95% CI]: 0.78 [0.76-0.81] vs. 0.81 [0.79-0.83]; p=0.048) and French ACS patients (0.77 [0.74-0.81] vs. 0.84 [0.81-0.86]; p=0.002). The newly developed SEX-SHOCK score, now incorporating ST-segment elevation, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and left ventricular ejection fraction, outperformed ORBI in both sexes (females: 0.81 [0.78-0.83]; males: 0.83 [0.82-0.85]; p<0.001), which prevailed following internal and external validation in RICO (females: 0.82 [0.79-0.85]; males: 0.88 [0.86-0.89]; p<0.001) and SPUM-ACS (females: 0.83 [0.77-0.90], p=0.004; males: 0.83 [0.80-0.87], p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ORBI score showed modest sex-specific performance. The novel SEX-SHOCK score provides superior performance in females and males across the entire spectrum of ACS, thus providing a basis for future interventional trials and contemporary ACS management.","Sex-specific Prediction of Cardiogenic Shock After Acute Coronary Syndromes: The SEX-SHOCK ScoreWang Y, Zeller M, Auffret V, Georgiopoulos G, RÃ¤ber L, Roffi M, Templin C, Muller O, Liberale L, Ministrini S, Stamatelopoulos K, Stellos K, Camici GG, Montecucco F, Rickli H, Maza M, Radovanovic D, Cottin Y, Chague F, Niederseer D, LÃ¼scher TF, Kraler S.Eur Heart J. 2024 Sep 1:ehae593. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehae593.

The newly developed SEX-SHOCK score, now incorporating ST-segment elevation, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and left ventricular ejection fraction, outperformed ORBI in both sexes (females: 0.81 [0.78-0.83]; males: 0.83 [0.82-0.85]; p<0.001), which prevailed following internal and external validation in RICO (females: 0.82 [0.79-0.85]; males: 0.88 [0.86-0.89]; p<0.001) and SPUM-ACS (females: 0.83 [0.77-0.90], p=0.004; males: 0.83 [0.80-0.87], p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ORBI score showed modest sex-specific performance. The novel SEX-SHOCK score provides superior performance in females and males across the entire spectrum of ACS, thus providing a basis for future interventional trials and contemporary ACS management.",True,2,computer vision and text mining,[]

The lack of quantifiable biomarkers for inactivity complicates the assessment of its relative importance compared to other conditions under the syndromic diagnosis of ICUAW. We hypothesize that active movement, as opposed to passive movement without active patient participation, can serve as a valid proxy for activity and may help predict muscle atrophy. To test this hypothesis, we utilized non-invasive, body-fixed accelerometers to compute measures of active movement and subsequently developed a machine learning model to predict muscle atrophy.
METHODS: This study was conducted as a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study as part of the MINCE registry (metabolism and nutrition in neurointensive care, DRKS-ID: DRKS00031472). Atrophy of rectus femoris muscle (RFM) relative to baseline (day 0) was evaluated at days 3, 7 and 10 after intensive care unit (ICU) admission and served as the dependent variable in a generalized linear mixed model with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regularization and nested-cross validation.
RESULTS: Out of 407 patients screened, 53 patients (age: 59.2Â years (SD 15.9), 31 (58.5%) male) with a total of 91 available accelerometer datasets were enrolled. RFM thickness changed -â19.5% (SD 12.0) by day 10. Out of 12 demographic, clinical, nutritional and accelerometer-derived variables, baseline RFM muscle mass (beta -â5.1, 95% CI -â7.9 to -â3.8) and proportion of active movement (% activity) (beta 1.6, 95% CI 0.1 to 4.9) were selected as significant predictors of muscle atrophy. Including movement features into the prediction model substantially improved performance on an unseen test data set (including movement features: R2â=â79%; excluding movement features: R2â=â55%).
CONCLUSION: Active movement, as measured with thigh-fixed accelerometers, is a key risk factor for muscle atrophy in neurocritical care patients. Quantifiable biomarkers reflecting the level of activity can support more precise phenotyping of ICUAW and may direct tailored interventions to support activity in the ICU. Studies addressing the external validity of these findings beyond the neurointensive care unit are warranted.

Accurate prediction of sepsis outcomes is crucial for effective treatment and management. Previous studies have utilized machine learning for prognosis, but have limitations in feature sets and model interpretability.
AIM: This study aims to develop a machine learning model that enhances prediction accuracy for sepsis outcomes using a reduced set of features, thereby addressing the limitations of previous studies and enhancing model interpretability.
METHODS: This study analyzes intensive care patient outcomes using the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adult sepsis cases. Employing the latest data extraction tools, such as Google BigQuery, and following stringent selection criteria, we selected 38 features in this study. This selection is also informed by a comprehensive literature review and clinical expertise. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, regrouping categorical variables, and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data. We evaluated several machine learning models: Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. The Sequential Halving and Classification (SHAC) algorithm was used for hyperparameter tuning, and both train-test split and cross-validation methodologies were employed for performance and computational efficiency.
RESULTS: The Random Forest model was the most effective, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 with a confidence interval of Â±0.01. This significantly outperformed other models and set a new benchmark in the literature. The model also provided detailed insights into the importance of various clinical features, with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and average urine output being highly predictive. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis further enhanced the model's interpretability, offering a clearer understanding of feature impacts.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates significant improvements in predicting sepsis outcomes using a Random Forest model, supported by advanced machine learning techniques and thorough data preprocessing. Our approach provided detailed insights into the key clinical features impacting sepsis mortality, making the model both highly accurate and interpretable.

Predicting these outcomes at diagnosis, when important clinical decisions need to be made, has proven to be a difficult task.
METHODS: 52 clinical features from existing models or the literature were collected retrospectively within Â±48Â h of diagnosis among 1660 inpatient infections. A modified desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) was designed to encompass clinically-important severe events attributable to the acute infection (intensive care transfer due to sepsis, shock, colectomy/ileostomy, mortality) and/or 60-day recurrence. A deep neural network was constructed and interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). High-importance features were used to train a reduced, shallow network and performance was compared to existing conventional models (7 severity, 7 recurrence; after summing DOOR probabilities to align with conventional binary outputs) using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and DeLong tests.
FINDINGS: The full (52-feature) model achieved an out-of-sample AUROC 0.823 for severity and 0.678 for recurrence. SHAP identified 13 unique, highly-important features (age, hypotension, initial treatment, onset, PCR cycle threshold, number of prior episodes, antibiotic exposure, fever, hypotension, pressors, leukocytosis, creatinine, lactate) that were used to train a reduced model, which performed similarly to the full model (severity AUROC difference PÂ =Â 0.130; recurrence PÂ =Â 0.426) and significantly better than the top severity model (reduced model predicting severity 0.837, ATLAS 0.749; PÂ =Â 0.001). The reduced model also outperformed the top recurrence model, but this was not statistically-significant (reduced model recurrence AUROC 0.653, IDSA Recurrence Risk Criteria 0.595; PÂ =Â 0.196). The final, reduced model was deployed as a web application with real-time SHAP explanations.
INTERPRETATION: Our final model outperformed existing severity and recurrence models; however, it requires external validation. A DOOR output allows specific clinical questions to be asked with explainable predictions that can be feasibly implemented with limited computing resources.

However, models need to be evaluated for unequal performance across racial groups (ie, racial bias) so that existing racial disparities are not exacerbated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether racial bias exists in a predictive machine learning model that identifies 180-day cancer mortality risk among patients with solid malignant tumors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, a machine learning model to predict cancer mortality for patients aged 21 years or older diagnosed with cancer between January 2016 and December 2021 was developed with a random forest algorithm using retrospective data from the Mount Sinai Health System cancer registry, Social Security Death Index, and electronic health records up to the date when databases were accessed for cohort extraction (February 2022).
EXPOSURE: Race category.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were model discriminatory performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], F1 score) among each race category (Asian, Black, Native American, White, and other or unknown) and fairness metrics (equal opportunity, equalized odds, and disparate impact) among each pairwise comparison of race categories. True-positive rate ratios represented equal opportunity; both true-positive and false-positive rate ratios, equalized odds; and the percentage of predictive positive rate ratios, disparate impact. All metrics were estimated as a proportion or ratio, with variability captured through 95% CIs. The prespecified criterion for the model's clinical use was a threshold of at least 80% for fairness metrics across different racial groups to ensure the model's prediction would not be biased against any specific race.
RESULTS: The test validation dataset included 43â¯274 patients with balanced demographics. Mean (SD) age was 64.09 (14.26) years, with 49.6% older than 65 years. A total of 53.3% were female; 9.5%, Asian; 18.9%, Black; 0.1%, Native American; 52.2%, White; and 19.2%, other or unknown race; 0.1% had missing race data. A total of 88.9% of patients were alive, and 11.1% were dead. The AUROCs, F1 scores, and fairness metrics maintained reasonable concordance among the racial subgroups: the AUROCs ranged from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72-0.78) for Asian patients and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.77) for Black patients to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.79) for patients with other or unknown race; F1 scores, from 0.32 (95% CI, 0.32-0.33) for White patients to 0.40 (95% CI, 0.39-0.42) for Black patients; equal opportunity ratios, from 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98) for Black patients compared with White patients to 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00-1.04) for Black patients compared with patients with other or unknown race; equalized odds ratios, from 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) for Black patients compared with White patients to 1.16 (1.10-1.21) for Black patients compared with patients with other or unknown race; and disparate impact ratios, from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.89) for Black patients compared with White patients to 1.17 (95% CI, 1.12-1.22) for Black patients compared with patients with other or unknown race.

The objective of this study is to assess the incremental accuracy of RFA procedural data to predict post-ablation AF recurrence using machine learning model. Procedural data generated during RFA procedure were downloaded from CARTONET and linked to deidentified Mercy Health EHR data. Data were divided into train (70%) and test (30%) data for model development and validation.

At first, AutoML model only included Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Second, an AutoML model with procedural variables and demographical/clinical variables was developed. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were used to compare model performances using test data. Among 306 patients, 67 (21.9%) patients experienced 1-year AF recurrence. AUROC increased from 0.66 to 0.78 after adding procedural data in the AutoML model based on test data. For patients with AF recurrence, NRI was 32% for model with procedural data. Nine of 10 important predictive features were CARTO procedural data. From CARTO procedural data, patients with lower contact force in right inferior site, long ablation duration, and low number of left inferior and right roof lesions had a higher risk of AF recurrence. Patients with persistent AF were more likely to have AF recurrence. The machine learning model with procedural data better predicted 1-year AF recurrence than the model without procedural data.

Few ML studies have examined percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) outcomes. Our objective was to build, streamline, temporally validate, and use ML models for prediction of PCNL outcomes (intensive care admission, postoperative infection, transfusion, adjuvant treatment, postoperative complications, visceral injury, and stone-free status at follow-up) using a comprehensive national database (British Association of Urological Surgeons PCNL).
METHODS: This was an ML study using data from a prospective national database. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), deep neural network (DNN), and logistic regression (LR) models were built for each outcome of interest using complete cases only, imputed, and oversampled and imputed/oversampled data sets. All validation was performed with complete cases only. Temporal validation was performed with 2019 data only. A second round used a composite of the most important 11 variables in each model to build the final model for inclusion in the shiny application. We report statistics for prognostic accuracy.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The database contains 12 810 patients. The final variables included were age, Charlson comorbidity index, preoperative haemoglobin, Guy's stone score, stone location, size of outer sheath, preoperative midstream urine result, primary puncture site, preoperative dimercapto-succinic acid scan, stone size, and image guidance (https://endourology.shinyapps.io/PCNL_Demographics/). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was >0.6 in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This is the largest ML study on PCNL outcomes to date. The models are temporally valid and therefore can be implemented in clinical practice for patient-specific risk profiling. Further work will be conducted to externally validate the models.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We applied artificial intelligence to data for patients who underwent a keyhole surgery to remove kidney stones and developed a model to predict outcomes for this procedure.

It is necessary to screen OSAHS patients for depression early. However, there are no validated tools to assess the likelihood of depression in patients with OSAHS. This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and machine learning (ML) methods to construct a risk prediction model for depression, aiming to predict the probability of depression in the OSAHS population. Relevant features were analyzed and a nomogram was drawn to visually predict and easily estimate the risk of depression according to the best performing model.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Data from three cycles (2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2015-2016) were selected from the NHANES database, and 16 influencing factors were screened and included. Three prediction models were established by the logistic regression algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and random forest algorithm, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess evaluate and compare the different ML models.
RESULTS: The logistic regression model had lower sensitivity than the lasso model, while the specificity and AUC area were higher than the random forest and lasso models. Moreover, when the threshold probability range was 0.19-0.25 and 0.45-0.82, the net benefit of the logistic regression model was the largest. The logistic regression model clarified the factors contributing to depression, including gender, general health condition, body mass index (BMI), smoking, OSAHS severity, age, education level, ratio of family income to poverty (PIR), and asthma.
CONCLUSION: This study developed three machine learning (ML) models (logistic regression model, lasso model, and random forest model) using the NHANES database to predict depression and identify influencing factors among OSAHS patients. Among them, the logistic regression model was superior to the lasso and random forest models in overall prediction performance. By drawing the nomogram and applying it to the sleep testing center or sleep clinic, sleep technicians and medical staff can quickly and easily identify whether OSAHS patients have depression to carry out the necessary referral and psychological treatment.","A machine learning model to predict the risk of depression in US adults with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome: a cross-sectional studyLi E, Ai F, Liang C.Front Public Health. 2024 Jan 8;11:1348803. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1348803. eCollection 2023.OBJECTIVE: Depression is very common and harmful in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).

As such, the approach comprises the texture feature extraction from raw data based on well established approaches, such as a nnU-Net neural network and the Pyradiomics toolbox, a subsequent selection according to adequate conditions for the muscle tissue of the general population, and an importance-based ranking to further narrow the amount of meaningful features with respect to auxiliary targets. The performance was investigated with respect to the included auxiliary targets, namely age, body mass index (BMI), and fat fraction (FF).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of an automated machine-learning model in the identification of patients at high risk of adverse outcomes from surgery using only data in the electronic health record.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study was conducted among 1â¯477â¯561 patients undergoing surgery at 20 community and tertiary care hospitals in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) health network. The study included 3 phases: (1) building and validating a model on a retrospective population, (2) testing model accuracy on a retrospective population, and (3) validating the model prospectively in clinical care. A gradient-boosted decision tree machine learning method was used for developing a preoperative surgical risk prediction tool. The Shapley additive explanations method was used for model interpretability and further validation. Accuracy was compared between the UPMC model and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) surgical risk calculator for predicting mortality. Data were analyzed from September through December 2021.
EXPOSURE: Undergoing any type of surgical procedure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) at 30 days were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 1â¯477â¯561 patients included in model development (806â¯148 females [54.5%; mean [SD] age, 56.8 [17.9] years), 1â¯016â¯966 patient encounters were used for training and 254â¯242 separate encounters were used for testing the model. After deployment in clinical use, another 206â¯353 patients were prospectively evaluated; an additional 902 patients were selected for comparing the accuracy of the UPMC model and NSQIP tool for predicting mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for mortality was 0.972 (95% CI, 0.971-0.973) for the training set and 0.946 (95% CI, 0.943-0.948) for the test set. The AUROC for MACCE and mortality was 0.923 (95% CI, 0.922-0.924) on the training and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) on the test set. In prospective evaluation, the AUROC for mortality was 0.956 (95% CI, 0.953-0.959), sensitivity was 2148 of 2517 patients (85.3%), specificity was 186â¯286 of 203â¯836 patients (91.4%), and negative predictive value was 186â¯286 of 186â¯655 patients (99.8%). The model outperformed the NSQIP tool as measured by AUROC (0.945 [95% CI, 0.914-0.977] vs 0.897 [95% CI, 0.854-0.941], for a difference of 0.048), specificity (0.87 [95% CI, 0.83-0.89] vs 0.68 [95% CI, 0.65-0.69]), and accuracy (0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87] vs 0.69 [95% CI, 0.66, 0.72]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that an automated machine learning model was accurate in identifying patients undergoing surgery who were at high risk of adverse outcomes using only preoperative variables within the electronic health record, with superior performance compared with the NSQIP calculator. These findings suggest that using this model to identify patients at increased risk of adverse outcomes prior to surgery may allow for individualized perioperative care, which may be associated with improved outcomes.","Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Identify Patients Before Surgery at High Risk for Postoperative Adverse EventsMahajan A, Esper S, Oo TH, McKibben J, Garver M, Artman J, Klahre C, Ryan J, Sadhasivam S, Holder-Murray J, Marroquin OC.JAMA Netw Open. 2023 Jul 3;6(7):e2322285. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.22285.IMPORTANCE: Identifying patients at high risk of adverse outcomes prior to surgery may allow for interventions associated with improved postoperative outcomes; however, few tools exist for automated prediction.

METHODS: With IRB approval, an institutional retrospective cohort of intra-abdominal surgery patients in the 2005 to 2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was identified. Intraoperative data were obtained from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms to predict 30-day mortality using: 1) baseline variables and 2) baseline + intraoperative variables. Algorithms evaluated were: 1) logistic regression with elastic net selection, 2) random forest (RF), 3) gradient boosting machine (GBM), 4) support vector machine (SVM), and 5) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The sample was randomly divided into a training/testing split with 80%/20% probabilities. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation identified the optimal model hyperparameters in the training dataset for each model, which were then applied to the entire training dataset to train the model. Trained models were applied to the test cohort to evaluate model performance. Statistical significance was evaluated using P < .05.
RESULTS: The training and testing cohorts contained 4322 and 1079 patients, respectively, with 62 (1.4%) and 15 (1.4%) experiencing 30-day mortality, respectively.

We hypothesised that a novel artificial intelligence approach could better assess multiple and higher-dimension interactions of comorbidities, and define clusters of Î²-blocker efficacy in patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: Neural network-based variational autoencoders and hierarchical clustering were applied to pooled individual patient data from nine double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of Î² blockers. All-cause mortality during median 1Â·3 years of follow-up was assessed by intention to treat, stratified by electrocardiographic heart rhythm. The number of clusters and dimensions was determined objectively, with results validated using a leave-one-trial-out approach. This study was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00832442) and the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42014010012).
FINDINGS: 15â659 patients with heart failure and LVEF of less than 50% were included, with median age 65 years (IQR 56-72) and LVEF 27% (IQR 21-33). 3708 (24%) patients were women. In sinus rhythm (n=12â822), most clusters demonstrated a consistent overall mortality benefit from Î² blockers, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0Â·54 to 0Â·74. One cluster in sinus rhythm of older patients with less severe symptoms showed no significant efficacy (OR 0Â·86, 95% CI 0Â·67-1Â·10; p=0Â·22). In atrial fibrillation (n=2837), four of five clusters were consistent with the overall neutral effect of Î² blockers versus placebo (OR 0Â·92, 0Â·77-1Â·10; p=0Â·37). One cluster of younger atrial fibrillation patients at lower mortality risk but similar LVEF to average had a statistically significant reduction in mortality with Î² blockers (OR 0Â·57, 0Â·35-0Â·93; p=0Â·023). The robustness and consistency of clustering was confirmed for all models (p<0Â·0001 vs random), and cluster membership was externally validated across the nine independent trials.
INTERPRETATION: An artificial intelligence-based clustering approach was able to distinguish prognostic response from Î² blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF. This included patients in sinus rhythm with suboptimal efficacy, as well as a cluster of patients with atrial fibrillation where Î² blockers did reduce mortality.

RESULTS: Tweny-five patients were classified as cognitively stable and 17 patients demonstrated cognitive decline.

METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and acute respiratory failure admitted from 63 ICUs in Spain. The objective was to utilize an unsupervised clustering analysis to derive clinical COVID-19 phenotypes and to analyze patient's factors associated with mortality risk. Patient features including demographics and clinical data at ICU admission were analyzed. Generalized linear models were used to determine ICU morality risk factors. The prognostic models were validated and their performance was measured using accuracy test, sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves.
RESULTS: The database included a total of 2022 patients (mean age 64 [IQR 5-71] years, 1423 (70.4%) male, median APACHE II score (13 [IQR 10-17]) and SOFA score (5 [IQR 3-7]) points. The ICU mortality rate was 32.6%. Of the 3 derived phenotypes, the A (mild) phenotype (537; 26.7%) included older age (<â65Â years), fewer abnormal laboratory values and less development of complications, B (moderate) phenotype (623, 30.8%) had similar characteristics of A phenotype but were more likely to present shock. The C (severe) phenotype was the most common (857; 42.5%) and was characterized by the interplay of older age (>â65Â years), high severity of illness and a higher likelihood of development shock. Crude ICU mortality was 20.3%, 25% and 45.4% for A, B and C phenotype respectively.

METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and acute respiratory failure admitted from 63 ICUs in Spain. The objective was to utilize an unsupervised clustering analysis to derive clinical COVID-19 phenotypes and to analyze patient's factors associated with mortality risk. Patient features including demographics and clinical data at ICU admission were analyzed. Generalized linear models were used to determine ICU morality risk factors. The prognostic models were validated and their performance was measured using accuracy test, sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves.
RESULTS: The database included a total of 2022 patients (mean age 64 [IQR 5-71] years, 1423 (70.4%) male, median APACHE II score (13 [IQR 10-17]) and SOFA score (5 [IQR 3-7]) points. The ICU mortality rate was 32.6%. Of the 3 derived phenotypes, the A (mild) phenotype (537; 26.7%) included older age (<â65Â years), fewer abnormal laboratory values and less development of complications, B (moderate) phenotype (623, 30.8%) had similar characteristics of A phenotype but were more likely to present shock. The C (severe) phenotype was the most common (857; 42.5%) and was characterized by the interplay of older age (>â65Â years), high severity of illness and a higher likelihood of development shock. Crude ICU mortality was 20.3%, 25% and 45.4% for A, B and C phenotype respectively. The ICU mortality risk factors and model performance differed between whole population and phenotype classifications.
CONCLUSION: The presented machine learning model identified three clinical phenotypes that significantly correlated with host-response patterns and ICU mortality.

Our aim was to investigate whether the severity of chest imaging findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates with the risk of acute neuroimaging findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 who received care at our hospital between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, and underwent chest imaging within 10 days of neuroimaging. Chest radiographs were assessed using a previously validated automated neural network algorithm for COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity score). Chest CTs were graded using a Chest CT Severity scoring system based on involvement of each lobe. Associations between chest imaging severity scores and acute neuroimaging findings were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Twenty-four of 93 patients (26%) included in the study had positive acute neuroimaging findings, including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 7), infarction (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), or a combination of findings (n = 4). The average length of hospitalization, prevalence of intensive care unit admission, and proportion of patients requiring intubation were significantly greater in patients with acute neuroimaging findings than in patients without them (P &lt; .05 for all). Compared with patients without acute neuroimaging findings, patients with acute neuroimaging findings had significantly higher mean Pulmonary X-ray Severity scores (5.0 [SD, 2.9] versus 9.2 [SD, 3.4], P &lt; .001) and mean Chest CT Severity scores (9.0 [SD, 5.1] versus 12.1 [SD, 5.0], P = .041). The pulmonary x-ray severity score was a significant predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To compare different machine learning methods in predicting overall mortality in cirrhosis and to use machine learning to select easily scored clinical variables for a novel cirrhosis prognostic model.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used a retrospective cohort of adult patients with cirrhosis or its complications seen in 130 hospitals and affiliated ambulatory clinics in the integrated, national Veterans Affairs health care system from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015. Patients were followed up through December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Potential predictors included demographic characteristics; liver disease etiology, severity, and complications; use of health care resources; comorbid conditions; and comprehensive laboratory and medication data. Patients were randomly selected for model development (66.7%) and validation (33.3%). Three different statistical and machine learning methods were evaluated: gradient descent boosting, logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization, and logistic regression with LASSO constrained to select no more than 10 predictors (partial pathway model). Predictor inclusion and model performance were evaluated in a 5-fold cross-validation. Last, the predictors identified in the most parsimonious (the partial path) model were refit using maximum-likelihood estimation (Cirrhosis Mortality Model [CiMM]), and its predictive performance was compared with that of the widely used Model for End Stage Liver Disease with sodium (MELD-Na) score.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 107â¯939 patients with cirrhosis (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [9.6] years; 96.6% male; 66.3% white, 18.4% African American), the annual mortality rate ranged from 8.8% to 15.3%.

METHODS: The retrospective observational study assessed 55 surgical PDAC patients. Molecular subtypes were defined by immunohistochemical staining of KRT81. Tumors were manually segmented and 1606 radiomic features were extracted with PyRadiomics. A gradient-boosted-tree algorithm was trained on 70% of the patients (N = 28) and tested on 30% (N = 17) to predict KRT81+ vs. KRT81- tumor subtypes. A gradient-boosted survival regression model was fit to the disease-free and overall survival data. Chemotherapy response and survival were assessed stratified by subtype and radiomic signature. Radiomic feature importance was ranked.
RESULTS: The meanÂ±STDEV sensitivity, specificity and ROC-AUC were 0.90Â±0.07, 0.92Â±0.11, and 0.93Â±0.07, respectively. The meanÂ±STDEV concordance indices between the disease-free and overall survival predicted by the model based on the radiomic parameters and actual patient survival were 0.76Â±0.05 and 0.71Â±0.06, respectively. Patients with a KRT81+ subtype experienced significantly diminished median overall survival compared to KRT81- patients (7.0 vs. 22.6 months, HR 4.03, log-rank-test P = <0.001) and a significantly improved response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy over FOLFIRINOX (10.14 vs. 3.8 months median overall survival, HR 2.33, P = 0.037) compared to KRT81- patients, who responded significantly better to FOLFIRINOX over gemcitabine-based treatment (30.8 vs. 13.4 months median overall survival, HR 2.41, P = 0.027). Entropy was ranked as the most important radiomic feature.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine-learning based analysis of radiomic features enables the prediction of subtypes of PDAC, which are highly relevant for disease-free and overall patient survival and response to chemotherapy.","A machine learning algorithm predicts molecular subtypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with differential response to gemcitabine-based versus FOLFIRINOX chemotherapyKaissis G, Ziegelmayer S, LohÃ¶fer F, Steiger K, AlgÃ¼l H, Muckenhuber A, Yen HY, Rummeny E, Friess H, Schmid R, Weichert W, Siveke JT, Braren R.PLoS One. 2019 Oct 2;14(10):e0218642. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218642. eCollection 2019.PURPOSE: Development of a supervised machine-learning model capable of predicting clinically relevant molecular subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from diffusion-weighted-imaging-derived radiomic features.

It is strongly associated with major adverse events, which in turn leads to increased cost and poor outcomes (eg, need for nursing home due to cognitive impairment, stroke, and death). The ability to foresee patients at risk of delirium will guide the timely initiation of multimodal preventive interventions, which will aid in reducing the burden and negative consequences associated with delirium. Several studies have focused on the prediction of delirium. However, the number of studies in cardiac surgical patients that have used machine learning methods is very limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the application of several machine learning predictive models that can pre-emptively predict delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and compare their performance.
METHODS: We investigated a number of machine learning methods to develop models that can predict delirium after cardiac surgery. A clinical dataset comprising over 5000 actual patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a single center was used to develop the models using logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Bayesian belief networks (BBN), naÃ¯ve Bayesian, random forest, and decision trees.
RESULTS: Only 507 out of 5584 patients (11.4%) developed delirium. We addressed the underlying class imbalance, using random undersampling, in the training dataset. The final prediction performance was validated on a separate test dataset. Owing to the target class imbalance, several measures were used to evaluate algorithm's performance for the delirium class on the test dataset. Out of the selected algorithms, the SVM algorithm had the best F1 score for positive cases, kappa, and positive predictive value (40.2%, 29.3%, and 29.7%, respectively) with a P=.01, .03, .02, respectively. The ANN had the best receiver-operator area-under the curve (78.2%; P=.03). The BBN had the best precision-recall area-under the curve for detecting positive cases (30.4%; P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Although delirium is inherently complex, preventive measures to mitigate its negative effect can be applied proactively if patients at risk are prospectively identified. Our results highlight 2 important points: (1) addressing class imbalance on the training dataset will augment machine learning model's performance in identifying patients likely to develop postoperative delirium, and (2) as the prediction of postoperative delirium is difficult because it is multifactorial and has complex pathophysiology, applying machine learning methods (complex or simple) may improve the prediction by revealing hidden patterns, which will lead to cost reduction by prevention of complications and will optimize patients' outcomes.","Exploiting Machine Learning Algorithms and Methods for the Prediction of Agitated Delirium After Cardiac Surgery: Models Development and Validation StudyMufti HN, Hirsch GM, Abidi SR, Abidi SSR.JMIR Med Inform. 2019 Oct 23;7(4):e14993. doi: 10.2196/14993.BACKGROUND: Delirium is a temporary mental disorder that occasionally affects patients undergoing surgery, especially cardiac surgery.

Using in-hospital data available within the first 24 hours of admission, we aimed to develop more accurate models of risk prediction using both logistic regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) techniques, with a combination of demographic, physiologic, and biochemical information.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patient-level data were extracted from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database for patients who had experienced a cardiac arrest within 24 hours prior to admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the period January 2006 to December 2016. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The models were trained and tested on a dataset (split 90:10) including age, lowest and highest physiologic variables during the first 24 hours, and key past medical history. LR and 5 ML approaches (gradient boosting machine [GBM], support vector classifier [SVC], random forest [RF], artificial neural network [ANN], and an ensemble) were compared to the APACHE III and Australian and New Zealand Risk of Death (ANZROD) predictions. In all, 39,566 patients from 186 ICUs were analysed. Mean (Â±SD) age was 61 Â± 17 years; 65% were male. Overall in-hospital mortality was 45.5%. Models were evaluated in the test set. The APACHE III and ANZROD scores demonstrated good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.80 [95% CI 0.79-0.82] and 0.81 [95% CI 0.8-0.82], respectively) and modest calibration (Brier score 0.19 for both), which was slightly improved by LR (AUROC = 0.82 [95% CI 0.81-0.83], DeLong test, p < 0.001). Discrimination was significantly improved using ML models (ensemble and GBM AUROCs = 0.87 [95% CI 0.86-0.88], DeLong test, p < 0.001), with an improvement in performance (Brier score reduction of 22%). Explainability models were created to assist in identifying the physiologic features that most contributed to an individual patient's survival. Key limitations include the absence of pre-hospital data and absence of external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: ML approaches significantly enhance predictive discrimination for mortality following cardiac arrest compared to existing illness severity scores and LR, without the use of pre-hospital data.

The most common complication of CAS is new cerebral infarction. The authors have previously reported that the jellyfish sign-the rise and fall of the mobile component of the carotid plaque surface detected by carotid ultrasonography-suggests thinning and rupture of the fibrous cap over the unstable plaque content, such as the lipid-rich necrotic core or internal plaque hemorrhage. The authors' aim in the present study was to evaluate the risk of a new ischemic lesion after CAS by using many risk factors including calcification (size and location) and the jellyfish sign. METHODS Eighty-six lesions (77 patients) were treated with CAS. The presence of ischemic stroke was determined using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Risk factors included calcification of the plaque (classified into 5 groups for size and 3 groups for location) and the jellyfish sign, among others. Multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise analysis and partial least squares [PLS] analysis) was conducted, followed by a machine learning analysis using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on the log-linearized gaussian mixture network (LLGMN). The additive effects of the jellyfish sign and calcification on ischemic stroke after CAS were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Steel-Dwass test. RESULTS The stepwise analysis selected the jellyfish sign, proximal calcification (proximal Ca), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and patient age for the prediction model to predict new DWI lesions. The PLS analysis revealed the same top 3 variables (jellyfish sign, proximal Ca, and LDL cholesterol) according to the variable importance in projection scores. The ANN was then used, showing that these 3 variables remained. The accuracy of the ANN improved; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the stepwise analysis, the PLS analysis, and the ANN were 0.719, 0.727, and 0.768, respectively. The combination of the jellyfish sign and proximal Ca indicates a significantly increased risk for ischemic stroke after CAS. CONCLUSIONS The jellyfish sign, proximal Ca, and LDL cholesterol were considered to be important predictors for new DWI lesions after CAS. These 3 factors can be easily determined during a standard clinical visit. Thus, these 3 variables-especially the jellyfish sign and proximal Ca-may be useful for reducing the ischemic stroke risk in patients with stenosis of the cervical carotid artery.","Predicting ischemic stroke after carotid artery stenting based on proximal calcification and the jellyfish signIchinose N, Hama S, Tsuji T, Soh Z, Hayashi H, Kiura Y, Sakamoto S, Okazaki T, Ishii D, Shinagawa K, Kurisu K.J Neurosurg. 2018 May;128(5):1280-1288. doi: 10.3171/2017.1.JNS162379.

This article addresses the diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, and course of bipolar disorder after a manic episode as well as mania as a manifestation of neurologic disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder, especially right-sided cerebrovascular disease. Treatments (such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents) for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania. The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling, changes in gene expression, neural network interactions, and apoptosis. Except when induced by time-limited treatment with a provoking agent, mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression. Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment refractory with time, although effective treatment improves the long-term outcome.
SUMMARY: Behavioral manifestations of mania may be more obvious than affective symptoms, especially in patients with aprosodia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are often first-line acute treatments, but the evidence supporting their long-term prophylactic efficacy is questionable. In addition to being an established mood stabilizer, lithium has putative neuroprotective properties, although a side effect can be impaired memory.","ManiaDubovsky SL.Continuum (Minneap Minn). 2015 Jun;21(3 Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry):737-55. doi: 10.1212/01.CON.0000466663.28026.6f.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary mania and hypomania in full or subsyndromal forms are the defining features of bipolar disorder and are common in neurologic patients, as are manic syndromes precipitated by medications used to treat neurologic disorders. This article addresses the diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, and course of bipolar disorder after a manic episode as well as mania as a manifestation of neurologic disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder, especially right-sided cerebrovascular disease. Treatments (such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents) for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania. The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling, changes in gene expression, neural network interactions, and apoptosis. Except when induced by time-limited treatment with a provoking agent, mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression. Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment refractory with time, although effective treatment improves the long-term outcome.

The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) is the instrument most widely used to evaluate QoL in Heart Failure (HF) patients. It is a questionnaire containing 21 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 105. A best cut-off value for MLHFQ scores to identify those patients with good, moderate or poor QoL has not been determined.
OBJECTIVE: To determine a cut-off score for the MLHFQ based on the neural network (NN) approach. These cut-off scores will help discriminate between HF patients having good, moderate or poor QoL.
METHODS: This research was carried out in the context of a longitudinal cohort study of new patients attending specialized HF clinics in six participating centers in Quebec, Canada. Patients completed a questionnaire that included the MLHFQ. In addition to this scale, self-perceived health status and clinical information related to the severity of HF were obtained including: the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 6 minute walk test and survival status. We analyzed the database using NN and conventional statistical tools. The NN is a statistical program that recognizes clusters of MLHFQ and relates similar QoL measures to one another. Among the 531 eligible patients, 447 patients with complete questionnaires were used to build randomly two sets for training (learning set) and for testing (validation set) the NN.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 65 years and 24% were women. The median MLHFQ score was 45 (inter-quartile range: 27 to 64). NN identified 3 distinct clusters of MLHFQ that represent the full spectrum of possible scores on the MLHFQ. We estimated that a score of < 24 on the MLHFQ represents a good QoL, a score between 24 and 45 represents a moderate QoL, and a score > 45 represents a poor QoL. Validation with the different severity measures confirmed these categories. These cut-offs allowed us to reach a good total accuracy (91%). These cutoffs were strongly correlated with survival status (p = 0.004), self-perceived health status (p = 0.0032), NYHA functional class (p<0.0001) and standardized 6 minutes walk test (p = 0.05)
CONCLUSION: The identification of three levels of MLHFQ should be useful in clinical decision making.","Identifying relative cut-off scores with neural networks for interpretation of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaireBehlouli H, Feldman DE, Ducharme A, Frenette M, Giannetti N, Grondin F, Michel C, Sheppard R, Pilote L.Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2009;2009:6242-6. doi: 10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334659.BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is an important end point in heart failure (HF) studies.

This study was conducted to define the minimum number of days of growth data and the type of ANN required for the best prediction of PHS susceptibility. Four experiments were conducted in which broilers were weighed daily at 0800 h. In Experiment 1, Hubbard male broilers were reared to 50 d of age, with 13 developing PHS and 33 remaining normal (N), for a PHS:N ratio of 13:33. In Experiment 2, ANAK broilers were exposed to cool temperatures (16 to 17 C) from 17 to 42 d of age, resulting in a PHS:N ratio of 16:46 for males. In Experiments 3 and 4, Hubbard male and female chicks from a base population and a PHS-resistant line were exposed to cool temperatures from 17 to 42 d (Experiment 3) or 49 d of age (Experiment 4). The PHS:N ratios were 40:68 for males and 6:96 for females in Experiment 3 and 26:91 for males and 10:58 for females in Experiment 4. Four ANN, back propagation (BP3), Ward back propagation (WardBP), probabilistic (PNN), and general regression (GRNN), were evaluated for their ability to predict PHS in the shortest number of days based on daily growth velocities (BWd+1-BWd). A 100% prediction of PHS and N birds was considered the criterion of success. Starting with 14 d of data, each ANN was trained on daily growth velocity, and the number of predictive days was reduced with each run of the ANN. The best ANN was a GRNN, which correctly diagnosed PHS and N male broilers on 4 and 6 d of growth velocity data for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. The results were poorer with the BP3, WardBP, and PNN. The diagnostic ability of the neural network was not consistent over all four experiments. In Experiment 2, a minimum of 6 d was required for 100% PHS detection for males. In Experiment 3, the best diagnostic value for males was 93% PHS detection and 100% N detection at 15 d. For females, the 100% PHS detection occurred at a minimum of 8 d. In Experiment 4, males had 100% PHS and N detection at a minimum of 11 d. Females had a 100% PHS and N detection at a minimum of 10 d. An attempt to build a single neural network that would detect PHS susceptibility in Hubbard (Experiment 1) and ANAK (Experiment 2) broilers was unsuccessful. The application (validation) of neural networks between experiments also was not successful (data not presented).

How well a general-purpose AI language model performs diagnosis and triage relative to physicians and laypeople is not well understood.
METHODS: We compared the predictive accuracy of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)'s diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated synthetic case vignettes (<50 words; sixth-grade reading level or below) of both common (eg, viral illness) and severe (eg, heart attack) conditions to a nationally representative sample of 5000 lay people from the USA who could use the internet to find the correct options and 21 practising physicians at Harvard Medical School. There were 12 vignettes for each of four triage categories: emergent, within one day, within 1 week, and self-care. The correct diagnosis and triage category (ie, ground truth) for each vignette was determined by two general internists at Harvard Medical School. For each vignette, human respondents and GPT-3 were prompted to list diagnoses in order of likelihood, and the vignette was marked as correct if the ground-truth diagnosis was in the top three of the listed diagnoses. For triage accuracy, we examined whether the human respondents' and GPT-3's selected triage was exactly correct according to the four triage categories, or matched a dichotomised triage variable (emergent or within 1 day vs within 1 week or self-care). We estimated GPT-3's diagnostic and triage confidence on a given vignette using a modified bootstrap resampling procedure, and examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was by computing calibration curves and Brier scores. We also performed subgroup analysis by case acuity, and an error analysis for triage advice to characterise how its advice might affect patients using this tool to decide if they should seek medical care immediately.
FINDINGS: Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top three for 88% (42/48, 95% CI 75-94) of cases, compared with 54% (2700/5000, 53-55) for lay individuals (p<0.0001) and 96% (637/666, 94-97) for physicians (p=0Â·012). GPT-3 triaged 70% correct (34/48, 57-82) versus 74% (3706/5000, 73-75; p=0.60) for lay individuals and 91% (608/666, 89-93%; p<0.0001) for physicians. As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score=0Â·18) and triage (Brier score=0Â·22). We observed an inverse relationship between case acuity and GPT-3 accuracy (p<0Â·0001) with a fitted trend line of -8Â·33% decrease in accuracy for every level of increase in case acuity. For triage error analysis, GPT-3 deprioritised truly emergent cases in seven instances.
INTERPRETATION: A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below, physicians and better than lay individuals. We found that GPT-3's performance was inferior to physicians for triage, sometimes by a large margin, and its performance was closer to that of lay individuals. Although the diagnostic performance of GPT-3 was comparable to physicians, it was significantly better than a typical person using a search engine.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 in transforming cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports into text that is comprehensible to medical laypersons.
METHODS: ChatGPT with GPT-4 architecture was used to generate three different explained versions of 20 various CMR reports (n = 60) using the same prompt: ""Explain the radiology report in a language understandable to a medical layperson"". Two cardiovascular radiologists evaluated understandability, factual correctness, completeness of relevant findings, and lack of potential harm, while 13 medical laypersons evaluated the understandability of the original and the GPT-4 reports on a Likert scale (1 ""strongly disagree"", 5 ""strongly agree""). Readability was measured using the Automated Readability Index (ARI). Linear mixed-effects models (values given as median [interquartile range]) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: GPT-4 reports were generated on average in 52Â sÂ Â±Â 13. GPT-4 reports achieved a lower ARI score (10 [9-12] vs 5 [4-6]; pÂ <Â 0.001) and were subjectively easier to understand for laypersons than original reports (1 [1] vs 4 [4,5]; pÂ <Â 0.001). Eighteen out of 20 (90%) standard CMR reports and 2/60 (3%) GPT-generated reports had an ARI score corresponding to the 8th grade level or higher. Radiologists' ratings of the GPT-4 reports reached high levels for correctness (5 [4, 5]), completeness (5 [5]), and lack of potential harm (5 [5]); with ""strong agreement"" for factual correctness in 94% (113/120) and completeness of relevant findings in 81% (97/120) of reports. Test-retest agreement for layperson understandability ratings between the three simplified reports generated from the same original report was substantial (ICC: 0.62; pÂ <Â 0.001). Interrater agreement between radiologists was almost perfect for lack of potential harm (ICC: 0.93, pÂ <Â 0.001) and moderate to substantial for completeness (ICC: 0.76, pÂ <Â 0.001) and factual correctness (ICC: 0.55, pÂ <Â 0.001).
CONCLUSION: GPT-4 can reliably transform complex CMR reports into more understandable, layperson-friendly language while largely maintaining factual correctness and completeness, and can thus help convey patient-relevant radiology information in an easy-to-understand manner.","Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 makes cardiovascular magnetic resonance reports easy to understandSalam B, Kravchenko D, Nowak S, Sprinkart AM, Weinhold L, Odenthal A, Mesropyan N, Bischoff LM, Attenberger U, Kuetting DL, Luetkens JA, Isaak A.J Cardiovasc Magn Reson. 2024 Summer;26(1):101035. doi: 10.1016/j.jocmr.2024.101035. Epub 2024 Mar 7.BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly using Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) to better understand their own radiology findings.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 in transforming cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports into text that is comprehensible to medical laypersons.
METHODS: ChatGPT with GPT-4 architecture was used to generate three different explained versions of 20 various CMR reports (n = 60) using the same prompt: ""Explain the radiology report in a language understandable to a medical layperson"". Two cardiovascular radiologists evaluated understandability, factual correctness, completeness of relevant findings, and lack of potential harm, while 13 medical laypersons evaluated the understandability of the original and the GPT-4 reports on a Likert scale (1 ""strongly disagree"", 5 ""strongly agree""). Readability was measured using the Automated Readability Index (ARI). Linear mixed-effects models (values given as median [interquartile range]) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: GPT-4 reports were generated on average in 52Â sÂ Â±Â 13. GPT-4 reports achieved a lower ARI score (10 [9-12] vs 5 [4-6]; pÂ <Â 0.001) and were subjectively easier to understand for laypersons than original reports (1 [1] vs 4 [4,5]; pÂ <Â 0.001). Eighteen out of 20 (90%) standard CMR reports and 2/60 (3%) GPT-generated reports had an ARI score corresponding to the 8th grade level or higher. Radiologists' ratings of the GPT-4 reports reached high levels for correctness (5 [4, 5]), completeness (5 [5]), and lack of potential harm (5 [5]); with ""strong agreement"" for factual correctness in 94% (113/120) and completeness of relevant findings in 81% (97/120) of reports. Test-retest agreement for layperson understandability ratings between the three simplified reports generated from the same original report was substantial (ICC: 0.62; pÂ <Â 0.001).

Whether a general-purpose AI language model can perform diagnosis and triage is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Compare the general-purpose Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) AI model's diagnostic and triage performance to attending physicians and lay adults who use the Internet.
DESIGN: We compared the accuracy of GPT-3's diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated case vignettes of both common (e.g., viral illness) and severe (e.g., heart attack) conditions to lay people and practicing physicians. Finally, we examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was for diagnosis and triage.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The GPT-3 model, a nationally representative sample of lay people, and practicing physicians.
EXPOSURE: Validated case vignettes (&lt;60 words; &lt;6th grade reading level).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correct diagnosis, correct triage.
RESULTS: Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top 3 for 88% (95% CI, 75% to 94%) of cases, compared to 54% (95% CI, 53% to 55%) for lay individuals (p<0.001) and 96% (95% CI, 94% to 97%) for physicians (p=0.0354). GPT-3 triaged (71% correct; 95% CI, 57% to 82%) similarly to lay individuals (74%; 95% CI, 73% to 75%; p=0.73); both were significantly worse than physicians (91%; 95% CI, 89% to 93%; p<0.001). As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well-calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score = 0.18) and triage (Brier score = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below physicians and better than lay individuals. The model was performed less well on triage, where its performance was closer to that of lay individuals.","The Diagnostic and Triage Accuracy of the GPT-3 Artificial Intelligence ModelLevine DM, Tuwani R, Kompa B, Varma A, Finlayson SG, Mehrotra A, Beam A.medRxiv [Preprint]. 2023 Feb 1:2023.01.30.23285067. doi: 10.1101/2023.01.30.23285067.IMPORTANCE: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health care have been effective in many areas of medicine, but they are often trained for a single task using labeled data, making deployment and generalizability challenging.
