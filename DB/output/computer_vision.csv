In this retrospective study, DeepMedic, no-new-Unet (nn-Unet), and NVIDIA-net (nv-Net) were trained and tested using manual segmentations from preoperative MRI of glioblastoma (GBM) and low-grade gliomas (LGG) from the BraTS 2021 dataset (1251 in total), in addition to 275 GBM and 205 LGG acquired clinically across 12 hospitals worldwide. Data was split into 80% training, 5% validation, and 15% internal test data. An additional external test-set of 158 GBM and 69 LGG was used to assess generalisability to other hospitals' data. All models' median Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for both test sets were within, or higher than, previously reported human inter-rater agreement (range of 0.74-0.85). For both test sets, nn-Unet achieved the highest DSC (internalâ=â0.86, externalâ=â0.93) and the lowest Hausdorff distances (10.07, 13.87Â mm, respectively) for all tumor classes (pâ<â0.001). By applying Sparsified training, missing MRI sequences did not statistically affect the performance. nn-Unet achieves accurate segmentations in clinical settings even in the presence of incomplete MRI datasets. This facilitates future clinical adoption of automated glioma segmentation, which could help inform treatment planning and glioma monitoring.",computer vision,"['deep learning', 'bert']"

However, data concerning disease involvement outside of the right ventricular outflow tract are limited.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize the presence and distribution of ventricular myocardial fibrosis in a cohort of decedents experiencing sudden cardiac death caused by BrS.
METHODS: The authors evaluated 28 whole hearts from consecutive sudden cardiac death cases attributed to BrS and 29 hearts from a comparator group comprised of noncardiac deaths (control subjects). Cardiac tissue from 6 regions across the right and left ventricle were stained with Picrosirius red for collagen and tissue composition was determined using image analysis software. Postmortem genetic testing was performed in cases with DNA retained for analysis.
RESULTS: Of 28 BrS decedents (75% men; median age of death 25 years), death occurred in sleep or at rest in 24 of 28 (86%). The highest proportion of collagen was observed in the epicardial right ventricular outflow tract of the BrS group (23.7%; 95%Â CI: 20.8%-26.9%). Ventricular myocardium from BrS decedents demonstrated a higher proportion of collagen compared with control subjects (ratio 1.45; 95%Â CI: 1.22-1.71; PÂ < 0.001), with no significant interactions with respect to sampling location or tissue layer. There was insufficient evidence to support differences in collagen proportion in SCN5A-positive cases (nÂ =Â 5) when compared with control subjects (ratio 1.23; 95%Â CI: 0.75-1.43; P = 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: Brugada syndrome is associated with increased collagen content throughout right and left ventricular myocardium, irrespective of sampling location or myocardial layer.",computer vision,[]

The purpose of this study was to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary detection of stages 1, 2, and 3 in ROP and to evaluate its generalizability across different populations and camera systems.
DESIGN: Diagnostic validation study of CNN for stage detection.
PARTICIPANTS: Retinal fundus images obtained from preterm infants during routine ROP screenings.
METHODS: Two datasets were used: 5943 fundus images obtained by RetCam camera (Natus Medical, Pleasanton, CA) from 9 North American institutions and 5049 images obtained by 3nethra camera (Forus Health Incorporated, Bengaluru, India) from 4 hospitals in Nepal. Images were labeled based on the presence of stage by 1 to 3 expert graders. Three CNN models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation on datasets from North America alone, Nepal alone, and a combined dataset and were evaluated on 2 held-out test sets consisting of 708 and 247 images from the Nepali and North American datasets, respectively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Convolutional neural network performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: Both the North American- and Nepali-trained models demonstrated high performance on a test set from the same population: AUROC, 0.99; AUPRC, 0.98; sensitivity, 94%; and AUROC, 0.97; AUPRC, 0.91; and sensitivity, 73%; respectively. However, the performance of each model decreased to AUROC of 0.96 and AUPRC of 0.88 (sensitivity, 52%) and AUROC of 0.62 and AUPRC of 0.36 (sensitivity, 44%) when evaluated on a test set from the other population. Compared with the models trained on individual datasets, the model trained on a combined dataset achieved improved performance on each respective test set: sensitivity improved from 94% to 98% on the North American test set and from 73% to 82% on the Nepali test set.
CONCLUSIONS: A CNN can identify accurately the presence of ROP stage in retinal images, but performance depends on the similarity between training and testing populations. We demonstrated that internal and external performance can be improved by increasing the heterogeneity of the training dataset features of the training dataset, in this case by combining images from different populations and cameras.",computer vision,"['neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'convolutional neural network']"

To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and sequences. ENIGMA projects commonly address this heterogeneity with random-effects meta-analysis or mixed-effects mega-analysis. Here we tested whether the batch adjustment method, ComBat, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and ComBat mega-analyses to compare cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of ComBat substantially increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to random-effects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing ComBat with mixed-effects mega-analysis, although ComBat still slightly increased the statistical significance. ComBat also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we applied the ComBat harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the ComBat function to attenuate potential effects of site in ENIGMA projects and other multi-site structural imaging work. We provide easy-to-use functions in R that work even if imaging data are partially missing in some brain regions, and they can be trained with one data set and then applied to another (a requirement for some analyses such as machine learning).",computer vision,['dl']

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) and cardio phrenic lymph nodes (CPLN) are pathological findings of computed tomography (CT) and are relevant for surgical planning. Furthermore, mammographic breast density (BD) has shown an association with OC risk and might be prognostically relevant. However, it is not known if PC, CPLN, and BD are associated with aggressive OC subtypes and impaired OC survival. Herein, we investigated associations between three comprehensive image parameters and OC subtypes and survival.
METHODS: The MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective study that included 17,035 women (1991-1996). Tumor information on 159 OC and information on OC specific survival (last follow-up, 2017-12-31) was registered. The CT and mammography closest to diagnosis were evaluated (Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index PCI, CPLN, and BD). Associations between CT-PCI, CPLN, and BD vs. clinical stage [stage I vs. advanced stage (II-IV), histological type/grade (high grade serous and endometrioid vs. other subtypes], and OC-specific survival were analyzed by logistic and Cox regression.
RESULTS: There was a significant association between higher CT-PCI score and advanced clinical stage (adjusted OR 1.26 (1.07-1.49)), adjusted for age at diagnosis and histological type/grade. Increasing CT-PCI was significantly associated with impaired OC specific survival (adjusted HR 1.04 (1.01-1.07)), adjusted for age at diagnosis, histological type/grade, and clinical stage. There was no significant association between PCI and histological type/grade, nor between BD or CPLN vs. the studied outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Image PCI score was significantly associated with advanced clinical stages and impaired OC survival. An objective approach (based on imaging) to scoring peritoneal carcinomatosis in ovarian cancer could help surgeons and oncologists to optimize surgical planning, treatment, and care.",computer vision,[]

The automation of hippocampal segmentation has been investigated in normal aging, epilepsy, and in Alzheimer's disease. Our first goal was to compare manual and automated hippocampal segmentation in ischemic stroke and to, secondly, study the impact of stroke lesion presence on hippocampal volume estimation. We used eight automated methods to segment T1-weighted MR images from 105 ischemic stroke patients and 39 age-matched controls sampled from the Cognition And Neocortical Volume After Stroke (CANVAS) study. The methods were: AdaBoost, Atlas-based Hippocampal Segmentation (ABHS) from the IDeALab, Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) using 3 atlas variants (Hammers, LPBA40 and Neuromorphometics), FIRST, FreeSurfer v5.3, and FreeSurfer v6.0-Subfields. A number of these methods were employed to re-segment the T1 images for the stroke group after the stroke lesions were masked (i.e., removed). The automated methods were assessed on eight measures: process yield (i.e. segmentation success rate), correlation (Pearson's R and Shrout's ICC), concordance (Lin's RC and Kandall's W), slope 'a' of best-fit line from correlation plots, percentage of outliers from Bland-Altman plots, and significance of control-stroke difference. We eliminated the redundant measures after analysing between-measure correlations using Spearman's rank correlation. We ranked the automated methods based on the sum of the remaining non-redundant measures where each measure ranged between 0 and 1. Subfields attained an overall score of 96.3%, followed by AdaBoost (95.0%) and FIRST (94.7%). CAT using the LPBA40 atlas inflated hippocampal volumes the most, while the Hammers atlas returned the smallest volumes overall. FIRST (pâ¯=â¯0.014), FreeSurfer v5.3 (pâ¯=â¯0.007), manual tracing (pâ¯=â¯0.049), and CAT using the Neuromorphometics atlas (pâ¯=â¯0.017) all showed a significantly reduced hippocampal volume mean for the stroke group compared to control at three months. Moreover, masking of the stroke lesions prior to segmentation resulted in hippocampal volumes which agreed less with manual tracing. These findings recommend an automated segmentation without lesion masking as a more reliable procedure for the estimation of hippocampal volume in ischemic stroke.",computer vision,['dl']

In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment CT radiomic features to predict overall survival of esophageal cancer patients after chemoradiotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two datasets of independent centers were analyzed, consisting of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) and 41.4Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery if feasible. In total, 1049 radiomic features were calculated from the primary tumor volume. Recursive feature elimination was performed to select the 40 most relevant predictors. Using these 40 features and six clinical variables as input, two random forest (RF) models predicting 3-year overall survival were developed.
RESULTS: In total 165 patients from center 1 and 74 patients from center 2 were used. The radiomics-based RF model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95%CI 0.61-0.77), with the top-5 most important features for 3-year survival describing tumor heterogeneity after wavelet filtering. In the validation dataset, the RF model yielded an AUC of 0.61 (95%CI 0.47-0.75). Kaplan Meier plots were significantly different between risk groups in the training dataset (pâ=â.027) and borderline significant in the validation dataset (pâ=â.053). The clinical RF model yielded AUCs of 0.63 (95%CI 0.54-0.71) and 0.62 (95%CI 0.49-0.76) in the training and validation dataset, respectively. Risk groups did not reach a significant correlation with pathological response in the primary tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: A RF model predicting 3-year overall survival based on pretreatment CT radiomic features was developed and validated in two independent datasets of esophageal cancer patients. The radiomics model had better prognostic power compared to the model using standard clinical variables.",computer vision,[]

So far, there is still a lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools to sensitively detect AD in early stages and to predict individual disease progression. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) of the brain may be a promising novel tool. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether multifrequency-MRE (MMRE) can detect differences in hippocampal stiffness between patients with clinical diagnosis of dementia due to AD and healthy controls (HC). Further, we analyzed if the combination of three MRI-derived parameters, i.e., hippocampal stiffness, hippocampal volume and mean diffusivity (MD), improves diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic criteria for probable dementia due to AD were in line with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and were verified through history-taking (patient and informant), neuropsychological testing, routine blood results and routine MRI to exclude other medical causes of a cognitive decline. 21 AD patients and 21 HC (median age 75Â years) underwent MMRE and structural MRI, from which hippocampal volume and MD were calculated. From the MMRE-images maps of the magnitude |G*| and phase angle Ï of the complex shear modulus were reconstructed using multifrequency inversion. Median values of |G*| and Ï were extracted within three regions of interest (hippocampus, thalamus and whole brain white matter). To test the predictive value of the main outcome parameters, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Hippocampal stiffness (|G*|) and viscosity (Ï) were significantly lower in the patient group (both pÂ &lt;Â 0.001). ROC curve analyses showed an area under the curve (AUC) for |Â G*| of 0.81 [95%CI 0.68-0.94]; with sensitivity 86%, specificity 67% for cutoff at |G*|Â =Â 980Â Pa) and for Ï an AUC of 0.79 [95%CI 0.66-0.93]. In comparison, the AUC of MD and hippocampal volume were 0.83 [95%CI 0.71-0.95] and 0.86 [95%CI 0.74-0.97], respectively. A combined ROC curve of |G*|, MD and hippocampal volume yielded a significantly improved AUC of 0.90 [95%CI 0.81-0.99]. In conclusion, we demonstrated reduced hippocampal stiffness and reduced hippocampal viscosity, as determined by MMRE, in patients with clinical diagnosis of dementia of the AD type. Diagnostic sensitivity was further improved by the combination with two other MRI-based hippocampal parameters. These findings motivate further investigation whether MMRE can detect decreased brain stiffness already in pre-dementia stages, and whether these changes predict cognitive decline.",computer vision,['generative']

However, recent MRI studies have reported increased cortical thickness of visual and somatosensory areas in patients with migraine with aura, suggesting that such structural alterations were either due to increased neuronal density in the areas involved, or a result of multiple episodes of cortical spreading depression as part of aura attacks. Subsequent studies have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to methodological reasons, e.g. small number of subjects. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited females aged 30-60 years from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Brain MRI of females with migraine with aura (patients), their co-twins, and unrelated migraine-free twins (controls) were performed at a single centre and assessed for cortical thickness in predefined cortical areas (V1, V2, V3A, MT, somatosensory cortex), blinded to headache diagnoses. The difference in cortical thickness between patients and controls adjusted for age, and other potential confounders was assessed. Comparisons of twin pairs discordant for migraine with aura were also performed. Comparisons were based on 166 patients, 30 co-twins, and 137 controls. Compared with controls, patients had a thicker cortex in areas V2 [adjusted mean difference 0.032 mm (95% confidence interval 0.003 to 0.061), V3A [adjusted mean difference 0.037 mm (95% confidence interval 0.008 to 0.067)], while differences in the remaining areas examined were not statistically significant [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): V1 0.022 (-0.007 to 0.052); MT: 0.018 (-0.011 to 0.047); somatosensory cortex: 0.020 (-0.009 to 0.049)]. We found no association between the regions of interest and active migraine, or number of lifetime aura attacks.

Whether this condition is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is beneficial in persons with MS and CCSVI is controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of venous PTA in patients with MS and CCSVI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 177 patients with relapsing-remitting MS; 62 were ineligible, including 47 (26.6%) who did not have CCSVI on color Doppler ultrasonography screening. A total of 115 patients were recruited in the study timeframe. All patients underwent a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group trial in 6 MS centers in Italy. The trial began in August 2012 and concluded in March 2016; data were analyzed from April 2016 to September 2016. The analysis was intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to either venous PTA or catheter venography without venous angioplasty (sham).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two primary end points were assessed at 12 months: (1) a composite functional measure (ie, walking control, balance, manual dexterity, postvoid residual urine volume, and visual acuity) and (2) a measure of new combined brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, including the proportion of lesion-free patients. Combined lesions included T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions plus new or enlarged T2 lesions.
RESULTS: Of the included 115 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, 76 were allocated to the PTA group (45 female [59%]; mean [SD] age, 40.0 [10.3] years) and 39 to the sham group (29 female [74%]; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [10.6] years); 112 (97.4%) completed follow-up. No serious adverse events occurred. Flow restoration was achieved in 38 of 71 patients (54%) in the PTA group. The functional composite measure did not differ between the PTA and sham groups (41.7% vs 48.7%; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.34-1.68; Pâ=â.49). The mean (SD) number of combined lesions on magnetic resonance imaging at 6 to 12 months were 0.47 (1.19) in the PTA group vs 1.27 (2.65) in the sham group (mean ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.91; Pâ=â.03: adjusted Pâ=â.09) and were 1.40 (4.21) in the PTA group vs 1.95 (3.73) in the sham group at 0 to 12 months (mean ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.32-1.63; Pâ=â.45; adjusted Pâ=â.45). At follow-up after 6 to 12 months, 58 of 70 patients (83%) in the PTA group and 22 of 33 (67%) in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.11-6.28; Pâ=â.03; adjusted Pâ=â.09). At 0 to 12 months, 46 of 73 patients (63.0%) in the PTA group and 18 of 37 (49%) in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.81-4.01; Pâ=â.15; adjusted Pâ=â.30).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but largely ineffective technique; the treatment cannot be recommended in patients with MS.

The cause of this impairment remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if detectable brain changes occur during a 2-year period in HIV-positive individuals who were aviremic and treated with cART.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this longitudinal case-control study, participants underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment approximately 2 years apart. Data were collected from October 26, 2011, to March 1, 2016. Data from 92 HIV-positive individuals were acquired at Washington University in St Louis from ongoing studies conducted in the infectious disease clinic and AIDS Clinical Trial Unit. A total of 55 HIV-negative control participants were recruited from the St Louis community and a research participant registry. A total of 48 HIV-positive individuals who were aviremic and treated with cART and 31 demographically similar HIV-negative controls met the study requirements and were included in the analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brain volumes were extracted with tensor-based and voxel-based morphometry and cortical modeling. Raw scores from neuropsychological tests quantified cognitive performance. Multivariable mixed-effects models assessed the effect of HIV serostatus on brain volumes and cognitive performance, and determined if HIV serostatus affected how these measures changed over time. With HIV-positive participants, linear regression models tested whether brain volumes and cognitive performance were associated with measures of infection severity and duration of infection.
RESULTS: The 2 groups were demographically similar (HIV-positive group: 23 women and 25 men; mean [SD] age, 47.7 [13.2] years; mean [SD] educational level, 13.3 [3.4] years; and HIV-negative group, 16 women and 15 men; mean [SD] age, 51.2 [12.9] years; mean [SD] educational level, 14.5 [2.1] years). The HIV-positive participants had poorer neuropsychological test scores compared with controls on the Trail Making Test Part A (5.9 seconds; 95% CI, 1.5-10.3; Pâ=â.01), Trail Making Test Part B (27.3 seconds; 95% CI, 15.0-39.6; Pâ<â.001), Digit Symbol Substitution Task (-12.5 marks; 95% CI, -18.9 to -6.0; Pâ<â.001), Letter-Number Sequencing (-2.5 marks; 95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3; Pâ<â.001), Letter Fluency (-6.6 words; 95% CI, -11.5 to -1.6; Pâ=â.01), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised immediate recall (-2.4 words; 95% CI, -4.4 to -0.4; Pâ=â.05), after adjusting for age, sex, and educational level. Only changes in Trail Making Test Part A significantly differed between the groups. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were smaller in HIV-positive individuals compared with controls. However, changes in brain volume over time were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings are consistent with the idea that cognitive and structural brain changes may occur early after seroconversion, and argue that maintaining aviremia with cART can prevent or minimize progressive brain injury.",computer vision,[]

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible correlation between fatigue and morpho-volumetric features and site of dilated perivascular spaces (dPS), visible on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) in fatigued multiple sclerosis patients (FMS).
METHODS: We studied 82 relapsing remitting (RR) FMS patients and 43 HC, matched for age, sex, and education. F was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). To evaluate a possible correlation between degree of F and characteristics of dPS, patients were divided in two groups: more (mFMS) (FSSââ¥â5; nâ=â30) and less fatigued (lFMS) (FSSââ¥â4; nâ=â52), compared to a matched healthy control (HC) subject group. The MR study was performed with 3T scanner by SpinEcho T1, Fast-SpinEcho DP-T2, FLAIR, and 3D FSPGR T1 sequences. dPS volumes were measured with Medical Image Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV); Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA), expressed as Brain Parenchymal Fraction (BPF), was assessed by FSL SIENAX.
RESULTS: The t test showed significantly increased dPS number (pâ=â0.021) in FMS patients (mFMS pâ=â0.0024 and lFMS pâ=â0.033) compared to HC. Pearson correlation revealed a significant correlation between dPS number and FSS (râ=â0.208 pâ=â0.051). Furthermore, the chi-squared test confirms the intragroup (HC, mFMS, lFMS) differences about dPS location (pâ=â0.01) and size (pâ=â0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that PS in MS patients presents with different volumetric and site characteristics as compared to HC; moreover, F severity significantly correlates with dPS number, site, and size.",computer vision,[]

In view of the pulsatility of the cerebral blood flow and refinement of software used for off-line analysis, we assessed the repeatability of retinal microvascular diameters in ECG-gated vs. non-gated images using nonmydriatic retinal photographs (Canon Cr-DGi visualization system) postprocessed by IVAN (Vasculomatic ala Nicola, version 1.1) or SIVA (Singapore I Vessel Assessment, version 3.6). Using these algorithms, we determined the central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular (CRVE) equivalents and their ratio (arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR)). The estimates of CRAE (mean, 158.5âÎ¼m), CRVE (222.5âÎ¼m) and AVR (0.71) in 10 volunteers were unaffected (Pâ©¾0.059) by ECG gating. We assessed intragrader repeatability by the Bland and Altman approach in 30 participants with non-gated images and 30 with ECG-gated photographs. Repeatability, which was expressed as the percentage of near maximal variability (4-s.d. range), did not improve with ECG gating. Using SIVA, CRAE and CRVE were systematically larger (Pâ©½0.031), and the AVR estimates were similar (Pâ©¾0.15) compared with IVAN. The differences (IVAN-SIVA) averaged -5.4âÎ¼m for CRAE, -3.9âÎ¼m for CRVE and -0.012 for AVR in the non-gated images and -3.3âÎ¼m, -6.9âÎ¼m and 0.006, respectively, in the ECG-gated photographs. In conclusion, ECG gating does not affect estimates of the retinal microvascular diameters or improve intragrader repeatability. SIVA yields slightly but significantly larger estimates of the retinal arteriolar and venular diameters. Combining historical readings analyzed by IVAN with more recent readings by SIVA is possible only for AVR and is not recommended for either CRAE or CRVE.",computer vision,['visual']

METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) data of 57 patients (40 males; median age, 66 years) undergoing TEVAR for thoracic aortic aneurysm (34 TAA, 19 TAAA) or penetrating aortic ulcer (nâ=â4) between 2001 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. In 28 patients, the Gore TAGÂ® stent-graft was used, followed by the Medtronic ValiantÂ® in 16 cases, the Medtronic TalentÂ® in 8, and the Cook ZenithÂ® in 5 cases. Proximal landing zone (PLZ) was in zone 1 in 13, zone 2 in 13, zone 3 in 23, and zone 4 in 8 patients. In 14 patients (25%), the procedure was urgent or emergent. In each case, pre- and postoperative CT angiography was analyzed using a dedicated image processing workstation and complimentary in-house developed software based on a 3D cylindrical intensity model to calculate aortic arch angulation and conicity of the landing zones (LZ).
RESULTS: Primary type Ia endoleak rate was 12% (7/57) and subsequent re-intervention rate was 86% (6/7). Left subclavian artery (LSA) coverage (pâ=â0.036) and conicity of the PLZ (5.9 vs. 2.6 mm; pâ=â0.016) were significantly associated with an increased type Ia endoleak rate. Bird-beak configuration was observed in 16 patients (28%) and was associated with a smaller radius of the aortic arch curvature (42 vs. 65 mm; pâ=â0.049). Type Ia endoleak was not associated with a bird-beak configuration (pâ=â0.388). Primary type Ib endoleak rate was 7% (4/57) and subsequent re-intervention rate was 100%. Conicity of the distal LZ was associated with an increased type Ib endoleak rate (8.3 vs. 2.6 mm; pâ=â0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: CT-based 3D aortic morphometry helps to identify risk factors of type I endoleak formation and bird-beak configuration during TEVAR. These factors were LSA coverage and conicity within the landing zones for type I endoleak formation and steep aortic angulation for bird-beak configuration.",computer vision,"['image processing', 'image processing']"

The brain plays a critical role in regulating energy balance. Some human studies have demonstrated increased preference for high fat and high sugar foods in people reporting greater stress exposure. We have examined neurochemical changes in the brain in rodent models during the development of obesity, including the impact of obesity on cognition, reward neurocircuitry and stress responsiveness. Using supermarket foods high in fat and sugar, we showed that such a diet leads to changes in neurotransmitters involved in the hedonic appraisal of foods, indicative of an addiction-like capacity of foods high in fat and/or sugar. Importantly, withdrawal of the palatable diet led to a stress-like response. Furthermore, access to this palatable diet attenuated the physiological effects of acute stress (restraint), indicating that it could act as a comfort food. In more chronic studies, the diet also attenuated anxiety-like behavior in rats exposed to stress (maternal separation) early in life, but these rats may suffer greater metabolic harm than rats exposed to the early life stressor but not provided with the palatable diet. Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. However, as little as 1 week of exposure to a high fat, high sugar diet selectively impaired place but not object recognition memory in the rat. Excess sugar alone had similar effects, and both diets were linked to increased inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, a critical region involved in memory. Obesity-related inflammatory changes have been found in the human brain. Ongoing work examines interventions to prevent or reverse diet-induced cognitive impairments. These data have implications for minimizing harm caused by unhealthy eating.",computer vision,"['object recognition', 'object recognition']"

Patients from the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center with ADPKD (n=590) with computed tomography/magnetic resonance images and three or more eGFR measurements over â¥6 months were classified radiologically as typical (n=538) or atypical (n=52). Total kidney volume (TKV) was measured using stereology (TKVs) and ellipsoid equation (TKVe). Typical patients were randomly partitioned into development and internal validation sets and subclassified according to height-adjusted TKV (HtTKV) ranges for age (1A-1E, in increasing order). Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Study of PKD (CRISP) participants (n=173) were used for external validation. TKVe correlated strongly with TKVs, without systematic underestimation or overestimation. A longitudinal mixed regression model to predict eGFR decline showed that log2HtTKV and age significantly interacted with time in typical patients, but not in atypical patients. When 1A-1E classifications were used instead of log2HtTKV, eGFR slopes were significantly different among subclasses and, except for 1A, different from those in healthy kidney donors. The equation derived from the development set predicted eGFR in both validation sets. The frequency of ESRD at 10 years increased from subclass 1A (2.4%) to 1E (66.9%) in the Mayo cohort and from 1C (2.2%) to 1E (22.3%) in the younger CRISP cohort. Class and subclass designations were stable.

Deauville response criteria consist of five ordinal categories based on visual comparison of residual tumor uptake to physiological reference uptakes. However, PET-response is a continuum and visual assessments can be distorted by optical illusions.
OBJECTIVES: With a novel semi-automatic quantification tool we eliminate optical illusions and extend the Deauville score to a continuous scale.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: SUVpeak of residual tumors and average uptake of the liver is measured with standardized volumes of interest. The qPET value is the quotient of these measurements. Deauville scores and qPET-values were determined in 898 pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma patients after two OEPA chemotherapy cycles.
RESULTS: Deauville categories translate to thresholds on the qPET scale: Categories 3, 4, 5 correspond to qPET values of 0.95, 1.3 and 2.0, respectively. The distribution of qPET values is unimodal with a peak representing metabolically normal responses and a tail of clearly abnormal outliers. In our patients, the peak is at qPET = 0.95 coinciding with the border between Deauville 2 and 3. qPET cut values of 1.3 or 2 (determined by fitting mixture models) select abnormal metabolic responses with high sensitivity, respectively, specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: qPET methodology provides semi-automatic quantification for interim FDG-PET response in lymphoma extending ordinal Deauville scoring to a continuous scale. Deauville categories correspond to certain qPET cut values. Thresholds between normal and abnormal response can be derived from the qPET-distribution without need for follow-up data. In our patients, qPET < 1.3 excludes abnormal response with high sensitivity.",computer vision,['visual']

Recent studies have suggested that some effects of transplanted stem cells are due to bystander effects that modulate the host environment, rather than direct effects of cell replacement. The extract from human adipose stem cells (ASCs) that secrete multiple growth factors including cytokines and chemokines may be a potential source of bystander effects for the treatment of epilepsy, in which inflammation is thought to play an important role. Here, we investigated the effects of a cytosolic extract of human ASCs (ASCs-E) in a mouse model of epilepsy.
METHODS: Human ASCs-E, boiled ASCs-E, or fibroblast-extract (fibroblast-E) was intraperitoneally administrated to C57BL/6 mice 15 min before pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) or during chronic epileptic stage. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage was evaluated by measuring Evans blue dye extravasation. Spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) was investigated by long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. The mice performed elevated plus maze, open-field, light/dark transition, and novel object recognition tasks.
KEY FINDINGS: Acute application of human ASCs-E before SE led to earlier attenuation of seizure spike activities after treatment with diazepam, reduction of BBB leakage, and inhibition of the development of epilepsy. Human ASCs-E treatment (for 7 days) during the chronic epileptic stage suppressed SRS and reduced abnormal epileptic behavioral phenotypes. However, neither boiled ASCs-E nor fibroblast-E had any effects in the experimental epilepsy model.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that human ASCs-E prevents or inhibits epileptogenesis and SRS in mice. They also suggest a stem cell-based, noninvasive therapy for the treatment of epilepsy.",computer vision,"['object recognition', 'object recognition']"

IDO activity is linked with immunosuppression by its ability to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, and with neurotoxicity through the generation of quinolinic acid and other toxins. IDO is induced in macrophages by HIV-1 infection, and it is up regulated in macrophages in human brain tissue with HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). Using a model of HIVE, we investigated whether IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-d-tryptophan (1-MT) could affect the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and clearance of virus-infected macrophages from the brain. Severe combined immunodeficient mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and encephalitis was induced by intracranial injection of autologous HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Animals treated with 1-MT demonstrated increased numbers of human CD3+, CD8+, CD8+/interferon-gamma+ T cells, and HIV-1(gag/pol)-specific CTLs in peripheral blood compared with controls. At week 2 after MDM injection in the basal ganglia, mice treated with 1-MT showed a 2-fold increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes in the areas of the brain containing HIV-1-infected MDMs compared with untreated controls. By week 3, 1-MT-treated mice showed 89% reduction in HIV-infected MDMs in brain as compared with controls. Thus, manipulation of immunosuppressive IDO activity in HIVE may enhance the generation of HIV-1-specific CTLs, leading to elimination of HIV-1-infected macrophages in brain.",computer vision,[]

Epub 2004 Sep 30.,Kumar R,Childs Nerv Syst,2005,2004/10/02,,,10.1007/s00381-004-1029-9,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a necrotizing bacterial infection with protean manifestation and wide distribution. There has been a great fall in the prevalence of tuberculosis in the United States since 1990, although the impact of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has increased the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB). Spinal tuberculosis is the commonest form of skeletal tuberculosis. In this article, an overview of spinal tuberculosis and the personal experience of 19 children with spinal tuberculosis are presented. All the children required surgical intervention, because they manifested neurological deficit. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL FEATURES: The spinal tuberculosis is a result of hematogenous dissemination from primary focus in the lungs or the lymph nodes. The central type of vertebral tuberculosis spreads along with Batson's plexus of veins, while paradiscal infection spreads through the arteries. The anterior type of vertebral body tuberculosis results from the extension of the abscess beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament and periosteum. Two types of bone and joint tuberculosis are recognized: the caseous, exudative type with abscess formation, which is more common in children, and the granular type is frequent in adults. Only 7 of the 19 children had an abscess, while 10 manifested mainly granulation tissue. Although spinal tuberculosis is an extradural disease, 2 children had intramedullary granulomas and presented a tumor-like syndrome as rare manifestations. It was interesting to encounter intradural granulation and organized intradural granuloma causing cord compression in 2 children. A frank abscess with clumping of nerve roots was encountered in the cauda of another child without vertebral involvement. There is a controversy regarding the age predilection of the disease; it is documented that it is a disease of adults in affluent countries, and a disease of the first three decades in other regions.
DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging is extremely useful in diagnosing the difficult and rare sites of disease like the craniovertebral junction. It detects the marrow changes, exudative and granulation types, extra- and intradural disease, and radiological response to treatment in the early follow-up period around 6-8 weeks.
TREATMENT: Opinion varies regarding the operative indication for Pott's spine. A large group of surgeons perform debridement and decompression in all cases, irrespective of neurological involvement. Others perform operative decompression only in those patients who do not respond to chemotherapy. We did surgical interventions in children with moderate to severe neurological deficits manifesting radiological compression of their neuraxis. Depending on the site of involvement and type of disease the surgical approach was decided in individual cases. Two children with healed Pott's spine also required surgery because of their spinal deformations, which caused gradual neurological deficits and pain in both. Prognosis depends on many factors; the magnitude of cord compression, duration of neural complication, age and general condition of patient. Fifteen of our children made a remarkable recovery. Children with paraplegia also made an excellent recovery of their strength and sensations.",computer vision,[]

Subjective assessment by radiologists indicated relative risks on the order of 4 to 6 for the group of women whose mammograms showed a density of over 75% or more of the projected area compared to those with an absence of density. In order to obtain a more quantitative, continuous and reproducible means of estimating breast density, which is sensitive to small changes, we have developed quantitative methods for the analysis of mammographic density, which can be applied to digitized mammograms. These techniques have been validated in a nested case-control study on 708 women aged 40-59 years (on entry) who participated in a national mammographic screening study. An interactive image segmentation method and two completely automated techniques based on image texture and grey scale histogram measures have been developed and evaluated. While our methods all show statistically significant risk factors for dense breasts, the interactive method currently provides the highest risk values (relative risk 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.12-7.56) compared to a measure based on the shape of the image histogram (relative risk 3.35, 95% CI = 1.57-7.12) or the fractal dimension of the mammogram (relative risk 2.54, 95% CI = 1.14-5.68). All methods were highly consistent between images of the left and right breast and between the two standard views (cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique) of each breast, so that studies can be done by sampling only one of the four views per examination. There is a large number of factors in addition to breast density which affect the appearance of the mammogram. In particular, the assessment of density is made difficult where the breast is not uniformly compressed, e.g. at the periphery. We have designed and are currently evaluating an image processing algorithm that effectively corrects for this problem and have considered methods for controlling some of the variables of image acquisition in prospective studies. Measurements of breast density may be helpful in assigning risk groups to women. Such measurements might guide the frequency of mammographic screening, aid the study of breast cancer aetiology, and be useful in monitoring possible risk-modifying interventions. Using our techniques, we have been able to show that reduction of the proportion of fat in the diet can result in reductions of breast density, although the direct connection to risk has not yet been made. The relationship between breast density and hormone-related and genetic factors is also of great interest. It is often not possible or ethical to obtain mammograms on some groups of women for whom information on density would be very useful. This includes younger women as well as groups in which it would be desirable to obtain such information at frequent intervals. For this reason, we are exploring the use of imaging approaches such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, which do not require ionizing radiation, to make measurements analogous to those now being performed by using X-ray mammograms.",computer vision,"['image processing', 'image processing']"

The AJCC-TNM system cannot accurately determine prognosis, our study aimed to identify prognostic factors for MHCC and to develop a prognostic model to quantify the risk and survival probability of patients.
METHODS: Eligible patients with HCC were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and then prognostic models were built using Cox regression, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The model's performance was evaluated using C-index, receiver operating characteristic curve, Brier score and decision curve analysis, respectively, and the best model was interpreted using SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpretability technique.
RESULTS: A total of eight variables were included in the follow-up study, our analysis identified that the gradient boosted machine (GBM) model was the best prognostic model for advanced MHCC. In particular, the GBM model in the training cohort had a C-index of 0.73, a Brier score of 0.124, with area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.78 at the first, third, and fifth year. Importantly, the model also performed well in test cohort. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis demonstrated that the newly developed risk stratification system could well differentiate the prognosis of patients.
CONCLUSION: Of the ML models, GBM model could predict the prognosis of advanced MHCC patients most accurately.",computer vision,['deep learning']

Epub 2024 Jul 10.,Smit KC,Clin Nutr ESPEN,2024,2024/07/12,,,10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.07.001,"BACKGROUND: Low muscle mass and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) loss are associated with adverse patient outcomes, but the time-consuming nature of manual SMM quantification prohibits implementation of this metric in clinical practice. Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of automated SMM quantification compared to manual quantification. We evaluated both diagnostic accuracy for low muscle mass and associations of SMM (change) with survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) images from CRC patients enrolled in two clinical studies were analyzed. We compared i) manual vs. automated segmentation of preselected slices at the third lumbar [L3] vertebra (""semi-automated""), and ii) manual L3-slice-selectionÂ +Â manual segmentation vs. automated L3-slice-selectionÂ +Â automated segmentation (""fully-automated""). Automated L3-selection and automated segmentation was performed with Quantib Body Composition v0.2.1. Bland-Altman analyses, within-subject coefficients of variation (WSCVs) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to evaluate the agreement between manual and automatic segmentation. Diagnostic accuracy for low muscle mass (defined by an established sarcopenia cut-off) was calculated with manual assessment as the ""gold standard"". Using either manual or automated assessment, Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were used to study the association between changes in SMM (>5% decrease yes/no) during first-line metastatic CRC treatment and mortality adjusted for prognostic factors. SMM change was also assessed separately in weight-stable (<5%, i.e. occult SMM loss) patients.
RESULTS: In total, 1580 CT scans were analyzed, while a subset of 307 scans were analyzed in the fully-automated comparison. Included patients (nÂ =Â 553) had a mean age of 63Â Â±Â 9 years and 39% were female. The semi-automated comparison revealed a bias ofÂ -2.41Â cm2, 95% limits of agreement [-9.02 to 4.20], a WSCV of 2.25%, and an ICC of 0.99 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.97 to 1.00). The fully-automated comparison method revealed a bias ofÂ -0.08Â cm2 [-10.91 to 10.75], a WSCV of 2.85% and an ICC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98 to 0.99). Sensitivity and specificity for low muscle mass were 0.99 and 0.89 for the semi-automated comparison and 0.96 and 0.90 for the fully-automated comparison. SMM decrease was associated with shorter survival in both manual and automated assessment (nÂ =Â 78/280, HR 1.36 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.80] and nÂ =Â 89/280, HR 1.38 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.81]). Occult SMM loss was associated with shorter survival in manual assessment, but not significantly in automated assessment (nÂ =Â 44/263, HR 1.43 [95% CI 1.01 to 2.03] and nÂ =Â 51/2639, HR 1.23 [95% CI 0.87 to 1.74]).
CONCLUSION: Deep-learning based assessment of SMM at L3 shows reliable performance, enabling the use of CT measures to guide clinical decision making. Implementation in clinical practice helps to identify patients with low muscle mass or (occult) SMM loss who may benefit from lifestyle interventions.",computer vision,[]

Disaster medicine (DM) has recently gained prominence as a critical issue due to the high frequency of worldwide disasters, especially in 2021. The new artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technologies and concepts have recently progressed in DM education.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to familiarize the reader with the remote technologies that have been developed and used in DM education over the past 20 years.
LITERATURE SCOPING REVIEWS: Mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, deep learning (DL), and visual reality stimulation, e.g., head-mounted display (HMD), are selected as promising and inspiring designs in DM education.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on the remote technologies applied in DM pedagogy for medical, nursing, and social work, as well as other health discipline students, e.g., paramedics. Databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), ISI Web of Science (WOS), EBSCO (EBSCO Essentials), Embase (EMB), and Scopus were used. The sourced results were recorded in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart and followed in accordance with the PRISMA extension Scoping Review checklist. We included peer-reviewed articles, Epubs (electronic publications such as databases), and proceedings written in English. VOSviewer for related keywords extracted from review articles presented as a tabular summary to demonstrate their occurrence and connections among these DM education articles from 2000 to 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 1,080 research articles on remote technologies in DM were initially reviewed. After exclusion, 64 articles were included in our review. Emergency remote teaching/learning education, remote learning, online learning/teaching, and blended learning are the most frequently used keywords. As new remote technologies used in emergencies become more advanced, DM pedagogy is facing more complex problems.
DISCUSSIONS: Artificial intelligence-enhanced remote technologies promote learning incentives for medical undergraduate students or graduate professionals, but the efficacy of learning quality remains uncertain. More blended AI-modulating pedagogies in DM education could be increasingly important in the future. More sophisticated evaluation and assessment are needed to implement carefully considered designs for effective DM education.",computer vision,"['deep learning', 'visual']"

So far, no study has evaluated whether ECG-based machine learning models have added value to predict in-hospital mortality specifically in COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: Using data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry, we studied 882 patients admitted with COVID-19 across seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Raw format 12-lead ECGs recorded within 72â¯h of admission were studied. With data from five hospitals (nâ¯=â634), three models were developed: (a)Â aÂ logistic regression baseline model using age and sex, (b)Â aÂ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model using age, sex and human annotated ECG features, and (c)Â aÂ pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) using age, sex and the raw ECG waveforms. Data from two hospitals (nâ¯=â248) was used for external validation.
RESULTS: Performances for modelsÂ a, b andÂ c were comparable with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.79), 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.82) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.83) respectively. Predictors of mortality in the LASSO model were age, low QRS voltage, ST depression, premature atrial complexes, sex, increased ventricular rate, and right bundle branch block.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the ECG-based prediction models could be helpful for the initial risk stratification of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and that several ECG abnormalities are associated with in-hospital all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, this proof-of-principle study shows that the use of pre-trained DNNs for ECG analysis does not underperform compared with time-consuming manual annotation of ECG features.",computer vision,"['dl', 'neural network']"

The retinal fundus is a window for human in vivo noninvasive assessment of the microvasculature. Large-scale complementary machine learning-based assessment of the retinal vasculature with phenome-wide and genome-wide analyses may yield new insights into human health and disease.
METHODS: We used 97â895 retinal fundus images from 54â813 UK Biobank participants. Using convolutional neural networks to segment the retinal microvasculature, we calculated vascular density and fractal dimension as a measure of vascular branching complexity. We associated these indices with 1866 incident International Classification of Diseases-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up) and 88 quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and ethnicity.
RESULTS: Low retinal vascular fractal dimension and density were significantly associated with higher risks for incident mortality, hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, anemia, and multiple ocular conditions, as well as corresponding quantitative traits. Genome-wide association of vascular fractal dimension and density identified 7 and 13 novel loci, respectively, that were enriched for pathways linked to angiogenesis (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, angiopoietin, and WNT signaling pathways) and inflammation (eg, interleukin, cytokine signaling).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the retinal vasculature may serve as a biomarker for future cardiometabolic and ocular disease and provide insights into genes and biological pathways influencing microvascular indices. Moreover, such a framework highlights how deep learning of images can quantify an interpretable phenotype for integration with electronic health record, biomarker, and genetic data to inform risk prediction and risk modification.",computer vision,"['deep learning', 'neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'convolutional neural network']"

Research into prognostication in ICU has so far been limited to data from admission or the first 24 hours. Most ICU admissions last longer than this, decisions are made throughout an admission, and some admissions are explicitly intended as time-limited prognostic trials. Despite this, temporal changes in prognostic ability during ICU admission has received little attention to date. Current predictive models, in the form of prognostic clinical tools, are typically derived from linear models and do not explicitly handle incremental information from trends. Machine learning (ML) allows predictive models to be developed which use non-linear predictors and complex interactions between variables, thus allowing incorporation of trends in measured variables over time; this has made it possible to investigate prognosis throughout an admission.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study uses ML to assess the predictability of ICU mortality as a function of time. Logistic regression against physiological data alone outperformed APACHE-II and demonstrated several important interactions including between lactate & noradrenaline dose, between lactate & MAP, and between age & MAP consistent with the current sepsis definitions. ML models consistently outperformed logistic regression with Deep Learning giving the best results. Predictive power was maximal on the second day and was further improved by incorporating trend data. Using a limited range of physiological and demographic variables, the best machine learning model on the first day showed an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.883 (Ï = 0.008), compared to 0.846 (Ï = 0.010) for a logistic regression from the same predictors and 0.836 (Ï = 0.007) for a logistic regression based on the APACHE-II score. Adding information gathered on the second day of admission improved the maximum AUC to 0.895 (Ï = 0.008). Beyond the second day, predictive ability declined.
CONCLUSION: This has implications for decision making in intensive care and provides a justification for time-limited trials of ICU therapy; the assessment of prognosis over more than one day may be a valuable strategy as new information on the second day helps to differentiate outcomes. New ML models based on trend data beyond the first day could greatly improve upon current risk stratification tools.",computer vision,['dl']

Epub 2024 Jul 18.,Sciannameo V,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2024,2024/07/19,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108326,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Researchers commonly use automated solutions such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to extract clinical information from large volumes of unstructured data. However, clinical text's poor semantic structure and domain-specific vocabulary can make it challenging to develop a one-size-fits-all solution. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), offer a promising solution for capturing and standardizing unstructured clinical information. This study evaluated the performance of InstructGPT, a family of models derived from LLM GPT-3, to extract relevant patient information from medical case reports and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs versus dedicated NLP methods.
METHODS: In this paper, 208 articles related to case reports of foreign body injuries in children were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A reviewer manually extracted information on sex, age, the object that caused the injury, and the injured body part for each patient to build a gold standard to compare the performance of InstructGPT.
RESULTS: InstructGPT achieved high accuracy in classifying the sex, age, object and body part involved in the injury, with 94%, 82%, 94% and 89%, respectively. When excluding articles for which InstructGPT could not retrieve any information, the accuracy for determining the child's sex and age improved to 97%, and the accuracy for identifying the injured body part improved to 93%. InstructGPT was also able to extract information from non-English language articles.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights that LLMs have the potential to eliminate the necessity for task-specific training (zero-shot extraction), allowing the retrieval of clinical information from unstructured natural language text, particularly from published scientific literature like case reports, by directly utilizing the PDF file of the article without any pre-processing and without requiring any technical expertise in NLP or Machine Learning. The diverse nature of the corpus, which includes articles written in languages other than English, some of which contain a wide range of clinical details while others lack information, adds to the strength of the study.",computer vision,[]

This research aims to disclose the outcomes and describe the management, clinical and imaging characteristics of patients diagnosed with Scimitar Syndrome treated in a tertiary referral healthcare center. Longitudinal descriptive observational study. The study included all patients diagnosed with scimitar syndrome in our institution between January/2011 and December/2022. A description of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, diagnostic tools used, treatment features, and patient outcomes is provided. Eleven patients were included, with a mean age at diagnosis of five years (CI 0-17), six of which were female (54.55%). Nine (81.82%) patients had evidence of a scimitar vein on the chest radiograph, six (54.55%) cardiac dextroposition, six (54.55%) pulmonary hypoplasia, five (45.45%) right pulmonary artery hypoplasia, and three (27.27%) had aortopulmonary collaterals. Four (36.36%) patients had horseshoe lungs, and four (36.36%) had bronchopulmonary sequestration. In the associations, two (18.18%) patients were found to have an atrial septal defect, three (27.27%) ventricular septal defect, and one (9%) had Tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary hypertension was demonstrated in two (18.18%) patients. Seven (63.64%) required surgical management to correct the scimitar vein, and two patients died due to unrelated complications. Scimitar syndrome presents diagnostic and treatment challenges, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach for timely care. Chest radiography and CT scans are primary diagnostic tools, with surgical intervention often warranted alongside other heart defects or significant hemodynamic repercussions. Medical management is effective for mild to moderate cases.

Current systems, like those run by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP), face challenges due to manual vetting and disparities in carcinogen classification spurred by the volume of emerging data. To address these issues, we introduced the Carcinogen Detection via Transformers (CarD-T) framework, a text analytics approach that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic statistical analysis to efficiently nominate carcinogens from scientific texts. CarD-T uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) trained on PubMed abstracts featuring known carcinogens from IARC groups and includes a context classifier to enhance accuracy and manage computational demands. Using this method, journal publication data indexed with carcinogenicity & carcinogenesis Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms from the last 25 years was analyzed, identifying potential carcinogens. Training CarD-T on 60% of established carcinogens (Group 1 and 2A carcinogens, IARC designation), CarD-T correctly to identifies all of the remaining Group 1 and 2A designated carcinogens from the analyzed text. In addition, CarD-T nominates roughly 1500 more entities as potential carcinogens that have at least two publications citing evidence of carcinogenicity. Comparative assessment of CarD-T against GPT-4 model reveals a high recall (0.857 vs 0.705) and F1 score (0.875 vs 0.792), and comparable precision (0.894 vs 0.903). Additionally, CarD-T highlights 554 entities that show disputing evidence for carcinogenicity. These are further analyzed using Bayesian temporal Probabilistic Carcinogenic Denomination (PCarD) to provide probabilistic evaluations of their carcinogenic status based on evolving evidence. Our findings underscore that the CarD-T framework is not only robust and effective in identifying and nominating potential carcinogens within vast biomedical literature but also efficient on consumer GPUs. This integration of advanced NLP capabilities with vital epidemiological analysis significantly enhances the agility of public health responses to carcinogen identification, thereby setting a new benchmark for automated, scalable toxicological investigations.",computer vision,"['text analytics', 'text analytics', 'transformer', 'transformer']"

OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model for HCC incidence in a cohort of patients with MASLD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study was conducted among patients aged at least 18 years with MASLD, identified using diagnosis of MASLD using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes; natural language processing of radiology imaging report text, which identified patients who had imaging evidence of MASLD but had not been formally diagnosed; or the Dallas Steatosis Index, a risk equation that identifies individuals likely to have MASLD with good precision. Patients were enrolled from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health delivery system with more than 4.6 million members, with study entry between January 2009 and December 2018, and follow-up until HCC development, death, or study termination on September 30, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed during February 2023 and January 2024.
EXPOSURE: Data were extracted from the electronic health record and included 18 routinely measured factors associated with MASLD.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The cohort was split (70:30) into derivation and internal validation sets; extreme gradient boosting was used to model HCC incidence. HCC risk was divided into 3 categories, with the cumulative estimated probability of HCC 0.05% or less classified as low risk; 0.05% to 0.09%, medium risk; and 0.1% or greater, high risk.
RESULTS: A total of 1â¯811â¯461 patients (median age [IQR] at baseline, 52 [41-63] years; 982â¯300 [54.2%] female) participated in the study. During a median (range) follow-up of 9.3 (5.8-12.4) years, 946 patients developed HCC, for an incidence rate of 0.065 per 1000 person-years. The model achieved an area under the curve of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.882-0.916) in the validation set. At the medium-risk threshold, the model had a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 81.4%, and a number needed to screen of 406. At the high-risk threshold, the model had a sensitivity of 78.4%, a specificity of 90.1%, and a number needed to screen of 241.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This prognostic study of more than 1.8 million patients with MASLD used electronic health record data to develop a prediction model to discriminate between individuals with and without incident HCC with good precision. This model could serve as a starting point to identify patients with MASLD who may need intervention and/or HCC surveillance.",computer vision,"['dl', 'language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'vision', 'natural language processing']"

Malnutrition is a highly associated predictive factor of dysphagia as well as one of the most common symptoms caused by dysphagia. Thus, the two conditions may exist simultaneously but also influence each other negatively and quickly cause functional decline especially in older adults. The purpose of this review was to determine whether institutions have established a protocol combining screenings for dysphagia and malnutrition on a global scale. If combined screening protocols have been implemented, the respective derived measures will be reported.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted. A systematic database search was carried out in January and February 2024. Studies were included that examined adult hospitalized patients who were systematically screened for dysphagia and malnutrition. The results were managed through the review software tool Covidence. The screening of titles and abstracts was handled independently by two reviewers; conflicts were discussed and resolved by consensus between three authors. This procedure was retained for full-text analysis and extraction. The extraction template was piloted and revised following feedback prior to extraction, which was carried out in February 2024.
RESULTS: A total of 2014 studies were found, 1075 of which were included for abstract screening, 80 for full text screening. In the end, 27 studies were extracted and reported following the reporting guideline PRISMA with the extension for Scoping Reviews.
CONCLUSION: Most of the studies considered the prevalence and association of dysphagia and malnutrition with varying outcomes such as nutritional status, pneumonia, oral nutrition, and swallowing function.

In addition, elevated pre-KF proteinuria was associated with KF/all-cause mortality events. CKD stage, nephrotic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease event rates, as well as the incremental costs of these events, were high.
BACKGROUND: FSGS leads to proteinuria and progressive decline in GFR, which correlates with kidney failure (KF) and increased cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effects of proteinuria on KF status/all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events/all-cause mortality, as well as the relationship between progression to KF and occurrence of CVD/mortality events among adult patients (18 years or older) with FSGS.
METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort study utilizing Optum deidentified Market Clarity Data and proprietary Natural Language Processing data. The study period was from January 1, 2007, through March 31, 2021, with patients in the overall cohort being identified from July 1, 2007, through March 31, 2021. The index date was the first FSGS ICD-10 diagnosis code or FSGS-related natural language processing term within the identification period.
RESULTS: Elevated proteinuria >1.5 and â¥3.5 g/g increased the risk of KF/all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 2.34 [1.99 to 2.74] and 2.44 [2.09 to 2.84], respectively) and CVD/all-cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI], 2.11 [1.38 to 3.22] and 2.27 [1.44 to 3.58], respectively). Progression to KF was also associated with a higher risk of CVD/all-cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI], 3.04 [2.66 to 3.48]).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients with FSGS experience KF and CVD events. Elevated proteinuria and progression to KF were associated with a higher risk of CVD/all-cause mortality events, and elevated pre-KF proteinuria was associated with progression to KF/all-cause mortality events. Treatments that meaningfully reduce proteinuria and slow the decline in GFR have the potential to reduce the risk of CVD, KF, and early mortality in patients with FSGS.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Many in this age group report substantial obstacles to receiving quality youth-centered mental health care services. With the rapid development of technology and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mobile health (mHealth) has presented new opportunities for youth mental health research, practice, and policy.
OBJECTIVE: The research objectives were to (1) synthesize the current evidence supporting mHealth interventions for youths who experience mental health challenges and (2) identify current gaps in the mHealth field related to youth's access to mental health services and health outcomes.
METHODS: Guided by the methods of Arksey and O'Malley, we conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed studies that used mHealth tools to improve youth mental health (January 2016-February 2022). We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases using the following key terms: (1) mHealth; (2) youth and young adults; and (3) mental health. The current gaps were analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: The search produced 4270 records, of which 151 met inclusion criteria. Included articles highlight the comprehensive aspects of youth mHealth intervention resource allocation for targeted conditions, mHealth delivery methods, measurement tools, evaluation of mHealth intervention, and youth engagement. The median age for participants in all studies is 17 (IQR 14-21) years. Only 3 (2%) studies involved participants who reported their sex or gender outside of the binary option. Many studies (68/151, 45%) were published after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Study types and designs varied, with 60 (40%) identified as randomized controlled trials. Notably, 143 out of 151 (95%) studies came from developed countries, suggesting an evidence shortfall on the feasibility of implementing mHealth services in lower-resourced settings. Additionally, the results highlight concerns related to inadequate resources devoted to self-harm and substance uses, weak study design, expert engagement, and the variety of outcome measures selected to capture impact or changes over time. There is also a lack of standardized regulations and guidelines for researching mHealth technologies for youths and the use of non-youth-centered approaches to implementing results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may be used to inform future work as well as the development of youth-centered mHealth tools that can be implemented and sustained over time for diverse types of youths. Implementation science research that prioritizes youths' engagement is needed to advance the current understanding of mHealth implementation. Moreover, core outcome sets may support a youth-centered measurement strategy to capture outcomes in a systematic way that prioritizes equity, diversity, inclusion, and robust measurement science. Finally, this study suggests that future practice and policy research are needed to ensure the risk of mHealth is minimized and that this innovative health care service is meeting the emerging needs of youths over time.",computer vision,[]

We performed an independent external validation for a recently derived and validated a novel electronic health record (EHR) VTE risk score in a comprehensive cancer center. Adult patients with incident cancer diagnoses were identified from MD Anderson Cancer Center Tumor Registry 1/2017-1/2021. Baseline covariates extracted at the time of first-line systemic therapy included demographics, cancer site/histology, stage, treatment, complete blood count, body mass index, recent prolonged hospitalization, and history of VTE or paralysis. VTE was ascertained using an institution-specific natural language processing radiology algorithm (positive predictive value of 94.8%). The median follow-up for 21â142 cancer patients was 8.1âmonths. There were 1067 (5.7%) VTE within 6âmonths after systemic therapy. The distribution of the novel score for 0-, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ was 5661, 3558, 3462, 3489, 2918, and 2054; while the corresponding 6-month VTE incidence was 1.3%, 3.1%, 5.4%, 7.3%, 9.3%, and 13.8%, respectively (c statistic 0.71 [95% CI 0.69-0.72] with excellent calibration). In comparison, the Khorana score had a c statistic of 0.64 [95% CI 0.62-0.65]. The two risk scores had 80% concordance; the novel score reclassified 20% of Khorana score (3530 low-to-high with 9.0% VTE; 734 high-to-low with 3.4% VTE) and led to a 25% increment in VTEs captured in the high-risk group. In conclusion, the novel score demonstrated consistent discrimination and calibration across cohorts with heterogenous demographics. It could become a new standard to select high-risk populations for clinical trials and VTE monitoring.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'llm', 'natural language processing']"

There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends.
OBJECTIVE: The key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports.
METHODS: The domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing.
RESULTS: The current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.
CONCLUSIONS: The DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for substance use epidemiology research.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Data regarding IPV-related injuries patterns and characteristics in males are scant. The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare patterns of IPV-related head and neck injuries between men and women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study reviewed cases of IPV at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia from January 2016 to August 2019. The study sample was collected from electronic medical records by identifying IPV subjects using a natural language processing algorithm and then cross-referencing the trauma registry to identify patients who sustained head and neck injuries. The primary analyses of interest were to measure the association between gender and the following covariates: age, race, insurance status, setting of injury, day of injury, social history, report of physical abuse, mechanism of injury, injury location, brain injuries, soft tissue injuries, facial fractures, other associated injuries, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and discharge status. Univariate and bivariate analyses were calculated. Statistical significance was PÂ <Â .05.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty six patients met inclusion criteria. There were 120 (76.9%) female patients with a mean age of 34.5Â years (range, 16 to 67 years). There were 36 (23%) male patients with a mean age of 43.8Â years (range, 18 to 77 years). Women were statistically more likely than men to have government-subsidized insurance (47 [39.2%] vs 7 [19.4%]; PÂ =Â .03), positive alcohol exposure (27 [22.5%] vs 19 [52.8%]; PÂ =Â .0001), positive illicit drugs toxicology screen (25 [20.8%] vs 13 [36.1%]; P < .02), report physical abuse (24 [20%] vs 0; PÂ =Â .004), have subarachnoid hemorrhage (14 [11.7%] vs 0; PÂ =Â .04), and/or lower extremity injuries (39 [32.5%] vs 5 [13.9%]; PÂ =Â .03).
CONCLUSION: Males tend not to report physical abuse; this behavior contributes to IPV under-reporting in males.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Although assessing such risks is best done by health care professionals, people experiencing suicidal ideation may not seek help. Hence, machine learning (ML) and computational linguistics can provide analytical tools for understanding and analyzing risks. This, therefore, facilitates suicide intervention and prevention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore, using statistical analyses and ML, whether computerized language analysis could be applied to assess and better understand a person's suicide risk on social media.
METHODS: We used the University of Maryland Suicidality Dataset comprising text posts written by users (N=866) of mental health-related forums on Reddit. Each user was classified with a suicide risk rating (no, low, moderate, or severe) by either medical experts or crowdsourced annotators, denoting their estimated likelihood of dying by suicide. In language analysis, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon assessed sentiment, thinking styles, and part of speech, whereas readability was explored using the TextStat library. The Mann-Whitney U test identified differences between at-risk (low, moderate, and severe risk) and no-risk users. Meanwhile, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for granular analysis between risk levels and to identify redundancy, respectively. In the ML experiments, gradient boost, random forest, and support vector machine models were trained using 10-fold cross validation. The area under the receiver operator curve and F<sub>1</sub>-score were the primary measures. Finally, permutation importance uncovered the features that contributed the most to each model's decision-making.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P&lt;.05) were identified between the at-risk (671/866, 77.5%) and no-risk groups (195/866, 22.5%). This was true for both the crowd- and expert-annotated samples. Overall, at-risk users had higher median values for most variables (authenticity, first-person pronouns, and negation), with a notable exception of clout, which indicated that at-risk users were less likely to engage in social posturing. A high positive correlation (Ï&gt;0.84) was present between the part of speech variables, which implied redundancy and demonstrated the utility of aggregate features. All ML models performed similarly in their area under the curve (0.66-0.68); however, the random forest and gradient boost models were noticeably better in their F<sub>1</sub>-score (0.65 and 0.62) than the support vector machine (0.52). The features that contributed the most to the ML models were authenticity, clout, and negative emotions.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our statistical analyses found linguistic features associated with suicide risk, such as social posturing (eg, authenticity and clout), first-person singular pronouns, and negation. This increased our understanding of the behavioral and thought patterns of social media users and provided insights into the mechanisms behind ML models. We also demonstrated the applicative potential of ML in assisting health care professionals to assess and manage individuals experiencing suicide risk.",computer vision,['computational linguistics']

The previous largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified SNCA and TMEM175 loci on chromosome (Chr) 4 with a significant influence on the AAO of PD; these have not been independently replicated. This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS of PD AAO and validate previously observed findings in worldwide populations.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on PD AAO GWAS of 30 populations of predominantly European ancestry from the Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease (COURAGE-PD) Consortium. This was followed by combining our study with the largest publicly available European ancestry dataset compiled by the International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC).
RESULTS: The COURAGE-PD Consortium included a cohort of 8,535 patients with PD (91.9%: Europeans and 9.1%: East Asians). The average AAO in the COURAGE-PD dataset was 58.9 years (SD = 11.6), with an underrepresentation of females (40.2%). The heritability estimate for AAO in COURAGE-PD was 0.083 (SE = 0.057). None of the loci reached genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5 Ã 10-8). Nevertheless, the COURAGE-PD dataset confirmed the role of the previously published TMEM175 variant as a genetic determinant of the AAO of PD with Bonferroni-corrected nominal levels of significance (p &lt; 0.025): (rs34311866: Î²(SE)<sub>COURAGE</sub> = 0.477(0.203), p <sub>COURAGE</sub> = 0.0185). The subsequent meta-analysis of COURAGE-PD and IPDGC datasets (N<sub>total</sub> = 25,950) led to the identification of 2 genome-wide significant association signals on Chr 4, including the previously reported SNCA locus (rs983361: Î²(SE)<sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = 0.720(0.122), p <sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = 3.13 Ã 10-9) and a novel BST1 locus (rs4698412: Î²(SE)<sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = -0.526(0.096), p <sub>COURAGE+IPDGC</sub> = 4.41 Ã 10-8).
DISCUSSION: Our study further refines the genetic architecture of Chr 4 underlying the AAO of the PD phenotype through the identification of BST1 as a novel AAO PD locus. These findings open a new direction for the development of treatments to delay the onset of PD.",computer vision,[]

Because manual review of medical records is labor intensive, a survival analysis using a large patient cohort with comprehensive clinical and histopathologic characteristics is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic significance of TILs among patients with cutaneous melanoma using a large cohort established through natural language processing (NLP) algorithms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the medical records of 14â¯436 patients with cutaneous melanoma at Brigham and Women's Hospital between June 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019. Patients were followed up to death or censored at their last clinical visit.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 14â¯436 patients with cutaneous melanoma were identified in the institution's pathology information system. Using NLP, we established a study cohort of 2624 patients (1462 men [55.7%]; median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 50-72 years]) who had vertical growth phase melanoma with TIL status scored. Absent TILs were identified in 434 patients (16.5%), nonbrisk TILs in 1916 patients (73.0%), and brisk TILs in 274 patients (10.4%). The 5-year survival rate was 71.0% (95% CI, 65.5%-76.9%) among patients with an absence of TILs, 73.8% (95% CI, 71.1%-76.5%) among patients with nonbrisk TILs, and 85.2% (95% CI, 80.0%-90.7%) among patients with brisk TILs. Brisk TILs were significantly associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; Pâ=â.03; 14.2% OS advantage at 5 years), and nonbrisk TILs were not associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.68-1.11; Pâ=â.25), compared with the absence of TILs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides evidence based on a large patient cohort from a single institution that suggests that brisk TILs represent an independent prognostic factor for OS among patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. The study also suggests that NLP is a highly efficient tool to facilitate large-scale analyses that involve free-text clinical data.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content.
METHODS: We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care.
RESULTS: Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'vision', 'natural language processing']"

Epub 2019 May 21.,Barbour K,Epilepsia,2019,2019/05/22,,,10.1111/epi.15966,"OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an important cause of mortality in epilepsy. However, there is a gap in how often providers counsel patients about SUDEP. One potential solution is to electronically prompt clinicians to provide counseling via automated detection of risk factors in electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated (1) the feasibility and generalizability of using regular expressions to identify risk factors in EMRs and (2) barriers to generalizability.
METHODS: Data included physician notes for 3000 patients from one medical center (home) and 1000 from five additional centers (away). Through chart review, we identified three SUDEP risk factors: (1) generalized tonic-clonic seizures, (2) refractory epilepsy, and (3) epilepsy surgery candidacy. Regular expressions of risk factors were manually created with home training data, and performance was evaluated with home test and away test data. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F-measure. Generalizability was defined as an absolute decrease in performance by <0.10 for away versus home test data. To evaluate underlying barriers to generalizability, we identified causes of errors seen more often in away data than home data. To demonstrate how small revisions can improve generalizability, we removed three ""boilerplate"" standard text phrases from away notes and repeated performance.
RESULTS: We observed high performance in home test data (F-measure range = 0.86-0.90), and low to high performance in away test data (F-measure range = 0.53-0.81). After removing three boilerplate phrases, away performance improved (F-measure range = 0.79-0.89) and generalizability was achieved for nearly all measures. The only significant barrier to generalizability was use of boilerplate phrases, causing 104 of 171 errors (61%) in away data.
SIGNIFICANCE: Regular expressions are a feasible and probably a generalizable method to identify variables related to SUDEP risk. Our methods may be implemented to create large patient cohorts for research and to generate electronic prompts for SUDEP counseling.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'vision', 'natural language processing']"

Claims-based studies have documented substantial economic burden of opioid abuse. This study utilized electronic health record (EHR) data to identify chronic opioid therapy (COT) patients with problem opioid use (POU) and compared costs with those for COT patients without POU. This study utilized EHR and claims data from an integrated health care system. Patients received COT (â¥70 days' supply in â¥1 calendar quarter, 2006-2012). Natural language processing (NLP) identified notations of opioid addiction, abuse, misuse, or overuse, and manual validation was performed. Cases had evidence of POU (indexâ=âfirst POU notation), and controls, sampled 9:1, did not. Health care resource utilization was measured and costs estimated using Medicare reimbursement rates. A longitudinal analysis of costs was conducted using generalized estimating equations. Adjusted analyses controlled for baseline age, gender, region, specific comorbidities, and a comorbidity index. The analysis population included 1,125 cases and 10,128 controls. Unadjusted costs were higher for cases in all three years.

Most existing prediction models do not take full advantage of the electronic health record, using only the single worst value of laboratory tests and vital signs and largely ignoring information present in free-text notes. Whether capturing more of the available data and applying machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can improve and automate the prediction of outcomes among patients in the ICU remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the change in power for a mortality prediction model among patients in the ICU achieved by incorporating measures of clinical trajectory together with NLP of clinical text and to assess the generalizability of this approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 101â¯196 patients with a first-time admission to the ICU and a length of stay of at least 4 hours. Twenty ICUs at 2 academic medical centers (University of California, San Francisco [UCSF], and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC], Boston, Massachusetts) and 1 community hospital (Mills-Peninsula Medical Center [MPMC], Burlingame, California) contributed data from January 1, 2001, through June 1, 2017. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, through August 1, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and model discrimination as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and model calibration as assessed by the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.
RESULTS: Among 101â¯196 patients included in the analysis, 51.3% (nâ=â51â¯899) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (17.1) years; their in-hospital mortality rate was 10.4% (nâ=â10â¯505). A baseline model using only the highest and lowest observed values for each laboratory test result or vital sign achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.830-0.832). In contrast, that model augmented with measures of clinical trajectory achieved an AUC of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902; Pâ<â.001 for AUC difference). Further augmenting this model with NLP-derived terms associated with mortality further increased the AUC to 0.922 (95% CI, 0.916-0.924; Pâ<â.001). These NLP-derived terms were associated with improved model performance even when applied across sites (AUC difference for UCSF: 0.077 to 0.021; AUC difference for MPMC: 0.071 to 0.051; AUC difference for BIDMC: 0.035 to 0.043; Pâ<â.001) when augmenting with NLP at each site.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive care unit mortality prediction models incorporating measures of clinical trajectory and NLP-derived terms yielded excellent predictive performance and generalized well in this sample of hospitals. The role of these automated algorithms, particularly those using unstructured data from notes and other sources, in clinical research and quality improvement seems to merit additional investigation.",computer vision,"['dl', 'language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Epub 2018 Oct 24.,Karavite DJ,Appl Clin Inform,2018,2018/10/26,PMC6200553,,10.1055/s-0038-1675179,"BACKGROUND: Surveillance for surgical site infections (SSIs) after ambulatory surgery in children requires a detailed manual chart review to assess criteria defined by the National Health and Safety Network (NHSN). Electronic health records (EHRs) impose an inefficient search process where infection preventionists must manually review every postsurgical encounter (< 30 days). Using text mining and business intelligence software, we developed an information foraging application, the SSI Workbench, to visually present which postsurgical encounters included SSI-related terms and synonyms, antibiotic, and culture orders.
OBJECTIVE: This article compares the Workbench and EHR on four dimensions: (1) effectiveness, (2) efficiency, (3) workload, and (4) usability.
METHODS: Comparative usability test of Workbench and EHR. Objective test metrics are time per case, encounters reviewed per case, time per encounter, and retrieval of information meeting NHSN definitions. Subjective measures are cognitive load using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and a questionnaire on system usability and utility.
RESULTS: Eight infection preventionists participated in the test. There was no difference in effectiveness as subjects retrieved information from all cases, using both systems, to meet the NHSN criteria. There was no difference in efficiency in time per case between the Workbench and EHR (8.58 vs. 7.39 minutes, pâ=â0.36). However, with the Workbench subjects opened fewer encounters per case (3.0 vs. 7.5, pâ=â0.002), spent more time per encounter (2.23 vs. 0.92 minutes, pâ=â0.002), rated the Workbench lower in cognitive load (NASA TLX, 24 vs. 33, pâ=â0.02), and significantly higher in measures of usability.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the EHR, the Workbench was more usable, short, and reduced cognitive load. In overall efficiency, the Workbench did not save time, but demonstrated a shift from between-encounter foraging to within-encounter foraging and was rated as significantly more efficient. Our results suggest that infection surveillance can be better supported by systems applying information foraging theory.",computer vision,"['text mining', 'visual']"

Epub 2018 Jun 27.,Kraus S,J Biomed Inform,2018,2018/05/19,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2018.05.008,"OBJECTIVE: The Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems is a standard for encoding and sharing medical knowledge in the form of Medical Logic Modules. To improve accessibility for clinicians, the originators of the standard deliberately designed Arden Syntax expressions to resemble natural language, and parentheses around operands are not generally required. For certain patterns of nested expressions, however, the use of parentheses is mandatory, otherwise they are not accepted by an Arden Syntax environment. In this study, we refer to such patterns as anomalies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent and the circumstances of such anomalies, and to outline a solution based on an alternative grammar encoding approach.
METHODS: To analyze the distribution of anomalies in nested expressions, we developed two custom-made complementary utilities. The first utility, termed parser, checks a single expression pattern against the specification-compliant grammar for syntactic correctness. The second utility, termed composer, automatically creates an extensive amount of expression patterns by permuting and nesting operators without the use of parentheses, and stores these together with the expected syntactic correctness. By means of these utilities we conducted a comprehensive analysis of anomalies by comparing the expected correctness with the actual correctness. Any detected anomalies are stored into a set of files, grouped by the respective top-level operator, for a subsequent analysis.
RESULTS: The composer utility nested 165 unary, binary, or ternary operators of Arden Syntax version 2.8 to a depth of two, resulting in a set of 76,533 expression patterns, of which 18,978 (24.8%) have been identified as anomalies. An automated assessment of their practical relevance for medical knowledge encoding is infeasible. Manual screening of selected samples indicated that only a small proportion of the detected anomalies would be relevant. The cause of the anomalies lies in the encoding of the grammar. A change of the basic encoding approach with some additional customizations eliminates the anomalies. A working expression parser is included in the supplementary material.
CONCLUSION: Arden Syntax expressions are affected by anomalies. Since only a small proportion of them have practical relevance and they cannot cause false calculations or clinical decisions, their practical impact is likely limited. However, they may be potential points of confusion for knowledge engineers. An alternative expression grammar, based on a different encoding approach, would not only eliminate the anomalies, but could considerably facilitate both maintenance and further development of the standard.",computer vision,['dl']

Information collected from manual or electronic health records can also be used for purposes not directly related to patient care delivery, in which case it is termed secondary use. EHR systems facilitate the collection of this secondary use data, which can be used for research purposes like observational studies, taking advantage of improvement in the structuring and retrieval of patient information. However, some of the following problems are common when conducting a research using this kind of data: (i) Over time, systems and data storage methods become obsolete; (ii) Data concerns arise since the data is being used in a context removed from its original intention; (iii) There are privacy concerns when sharing data about individual subjects; (iv) The partial availability of standard medical vocabularies and natural language processing tools for non-English language limits information extraction from structured and unstructured data in the EHR systems. A systematic approach is therefore needed to overcome these, where local data processing is performed prior to data sharing.
METHOD: The proposed study describes a local processing method to extract cohorts of patients for observational studies in four steps: (1) data reorganization from an existing local logical schema into a common external schema over which information can be extracted; (2) cleaning of data, generation of the database profile and retrieval of indicators; (3) computation of derived variables from original variables; (4) application of study design parameters to transform longitudinal data into anonymized data sets ready for statistical analysis and sharing. Mapping from the local logical schema into a common external schema must be performed differently for each EHR and is not subject of this work, but step 2, 3 and 4 are common to all EHRs. The external schema accepts parameters that facilitate the extraction of different cohorts for different studies without having to change the extraction algorithms, and ensures that, given an immutable data set, can be done by the idempotent process. Statistical analysis is part of the process to generate the results necessary for inclusion in reports. The generation of indicators to describe the database allows description of its characteristics, highlighting study results. The set extraction/statistical processing is available in a version controlled repository and can be used at any time to reproduce results, allowing the verification of alterations and error corrections. This methodology promotes the development of reproducible studies and allows potential research problems to be tracked upon extraction algorithms and statistical methods RESULTS: This method was applied to an admissions database, SI3, from the InCor-HCFMUSP, a tertiary referral hospital for cardiovascular disease in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, as a source of secondary data with 1116848 patients records from 1999 up to 2013. The cleaning process resulted in 313894 patients records and 27698 patients in the cohort selection, with the following criteria: study period: 2003-2013, gender: Male, Female, age:â¥18years old, at least 2 outpatient encounters, diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (ICD-10 codes: I20-I25, I64-I70 and G45). An R script provided descriptive statistics of the extracted cohort.
CONCLUSION: This method guarantees a reproducible cohort extraction for use of secondary data in observational studies with enough parameterization to support different study designs and can be used on diverse data sources. Moreover it allows observational electronic health record cohort research to be performed in a non-English language with limited international recognized medical vocabulary.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Epub 2015 Feb 5.,Cohen AM,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2015,2015/02/07,PMC4457112,,10.1093/jamia/ocu025,"OBJECTIVE: For many literature review tasks, including systematic review (SR) and other aspects of evidence-based medicine, it is important to know whether an article describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Current manual annotation is not complete or flexible enough for the SR process. In this work, highly accurate machine learning predictive models were built that include confidence predictions of whether an article is an RCT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LibSVM classifier was used with forward selection of potential feature sets on a large human-related subset of MEDLINE to create a classification model requiring only the citation, abstract, and MeSH terms for each article.
RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.973 and mean squared error of 0.013 on the held out year 2011 data. Accurate confidence estimates were confirmed on a manually reviewed set of test articles. A second model not requiring MeSH terms was also created, and performs almost as well.
DISCUSSION: Both models accurately rank and predict article RCT confidence. Using the model and the manually reviewed samples, it is estimated that about 8000 (3%) additional RCTs can be identified in MEDLINE, and that 5% of articles tagged as RCTs in Medline may not be identified.
CONCLUSION: Retagging human-related studies with a continuously valued RCT confidence is potentially more useful for article ranking and review than a simple yes/no prediction. The automated RCT tagging tool should offer significant savings of time and effort during the process of writing SRs, and is a key component of a multistep text mining pipeline that we are building to streamline SR workflow. In addition, the model may be useful for identifying errors in MEDLINE publication types.

Identification of genetic variants that influence the rate of cognitive decline or pattern of early cognitive deficits in PD might provide a clearer understanding of the etiopathogenesis of this important nonmotor feature.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether common variation in the APOE, MAPT, and SNCA genes is associated with cognitive performance in patients with PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 1079 PD patients from 6 academic centers in the United States who underwent assessments of memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R]), attention and executive function (Letter-Number Sequencing Test and Trail Making Test), language processing (semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tests), visuospatial skills (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test), and global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Participants underwent genotyping for the APOE Îµ2/Îµ3/Îµ4 alleles, MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes, and SNCA rs356219. We used linear regression to test for association between genotype and baseline cognitive performance with adjustment for age, sex, years of education, disease duration, and site. We used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the 9 comparisons that were performed for each gene.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nine variables derived from 7 psychometric tests.
RESULTS: The APOE Îµ4 allele was associated with lower performance on the HVLT-R Total Recall (P = 6.7 Ã 10(-6); corrected P [Pc]â= 6.0 Ã 10(-5)), Delayed Recall (P =â.001; Pc =â.009), and Recognition Discrimination Index (P =â.004; Pc =â.04); a semantic verbal fluency test (P =â.002; Pc =â.02); the Letter-Number Sequencing Test (P = 1 Ã 10(-5); Pc = 9 Ã 10(-5)); and Trail Making Test B minus Trail Making Test A (P =â.002; Pc =â.02). In a subset of 645 patients without dementia, the APOE Îµ4 allele was associated with lower scores on the HVLT-R Total Recall (P =â.005; Pc =â.045) and the semantic verbal fluency (P =â.005; Pc =â.045) measures. Variants of MAPT and SNCA were not associated with scores on any tests.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our data indicate that the APOE Îµ4 allele is an important predictor of cognitive function in PD across multiple domains. Among PD patients without dementia, the APOE Îµ4 allele was only associated with lower performance on word list learning and semantic verbal fluency, a pattern more typical of the cognitive deficits seen in early Alzheimer disease than PD.",computer vision,"['language processing', 'language processing']"

Machine learning may support radiologists reading whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.
OBJECTIVES: 1. To develop a machine-learning algorithm to detect normal organs and cancer lesions. 2. To compare diagnostic accuracy, time and agreement of radiology reads to detect metastases using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging with concurrent machine learning (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) against standard whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation).
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of (1) prospective single-centre study in healthy volunteersâ&gt;â18 years (nâ=â51) and (2) prospective multicentre STREAMLINE study patient data (nâ=â438).
TESTS: Index: whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning. Comparator: whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation.
REFERENCE STANDARD: Previously established expert panel consensus reference at 12 months from diagnosis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: difference in per-patient specificity between whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning and whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation. Secondary: per-patient sensitivity, per-lesion sensitivity and specificity, read time and agreement.
METHODS: Phase 1: classification forests, convolutional neural networks, and a multi-atlas approaches for organ segmentation. Phase 2/3: whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scans were allocated to Phase 2 (trainingâ=â226, validationâ=â45) and Phase 3 (testingâ=â193). Disease sites were manually labelled. The final algorithm was applied to 193 Phase 3 cases, generating probability heatmaps. Twenty-five radiologists (18 experienced, 7 inexperienced in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging) were randomly allocated whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning or whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation over two or three rounds in a National Health Service setting. Read time was independently recorded.
RESULTS: Phases 1 and 2: convolutional neural network had best Dice similarity coefficient, recall and precision measurements for healthy organ segmentation. Final algorithm used a âtwo-stageâ initial organ identification followed by lesion detection. Phase 3: evaluable scans (188/193, of which 50 had metastases from 117 colon, 71 lung cancer cases) were read between November 2019 and March 2020. For experienced readers, per-patient specificity for detection of metastases was 86.2% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and 87.7% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation), (difference â1.5%, 95% confidence interval â6.4% to 3.5%; pâ=â0.387); per-patient sensitivity was 66.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and 70.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation) (difference â4.0%, 95% confidence interval â13.5% to 5.5%; pâ=â0.344). For inexperienced readers (53 reads, 15 with metastases), per-patient specificity was 76.3% in both groups with sensitivities of 73.3% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and 60.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation). Per-site specificity remained high within all sites; above 95% (experienced) or 90% (inexperienced). Per-site sensitivity was highly variable due to low number of lesions in each site. Reading time lowered under machine learning by 6.2% (95% confidence interval â22.8% to 10.0%). Read time was primarily influenced by read round with round 2 read times reduced by 32% (95% confidence interval 20.8% to 42.8%) overall with subsequent regression analysis showing a significant effect (pâ=â0.0281) by using machine learning in round 2 estimated as 286 seconds (or 11%) quicker. Interobserver variance for experienced readers suggests moderate agreement, Cohenâs Îºâ=â0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.81 (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning) and Cohenâs Îºâ=â0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.81 (whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âstandard deviation).
LIMITATIONS: Patient whole-body magnetic resonance imaging data were heterogeneous with relatively few metastatic lesions in a wide variety of locations, making training and testing difficult and hampering evaluation of sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy for whole-body magnetic resonance imaging radiology reads with or without machine-learning support, although radiology read time may be slightly shortened using whole-body magnetic resonance imagingâ+âmachine learning.

The lack of quantifiable biomarkers for inactivity complicates the assessment of its relative importance compared to other conditions under the syndromic diagnosis of ICUAW. We hypothesize that active movement, as opposed to passive movement without active patient participation, can serve as a valid proxy for activity and may help predict muscle atrophy. To test this hypothesis, we utilized non-invasive, body-fixed accelerometers to compute measures of active movement and subsequently developed a machine learning model to predict muscle atrophy.
METHODS: This study was conducted as a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study as part of the MINCE registry (metabolism and nutrition in neurointensive care, DRKS-ID: DRKS00031472). Atrophy of rectus femoris muscle (RFM) relative to baseline (day 0) was evaluated at days 3, 7 and 10 after intensive care unit (ICU) admission and served as the dependent variable in a generalized linear mixed model with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regularization and nested-cross validation.
RESULTS: Out of 407 patients screened, 53 patients (age: 59.2Â years (SD 15.9), 31 (58.5%) male) with a total of 91 available accelerometer datasets were enrolled. RFM thickness changed -â19.5% (SD 12.0) by day 10. Out of 12 demographic, clinical, nutritional and accelerometer-derived variables, baseline RFM muscle mass (beta -â5.1, 95% CI -â7.9 to -â3.8) and proportion of active movement (% activity) (beta 1.6, 95% CI 0.1 to 4.9) were selected as significant predictors of muscle atrophy. Including movement features into the prediction model substantially improved performance on an unseen test data set (including movement features: R2â=â79%; excluding movement features: R2â=â55%).
CONCLUSION: Active movement, as measured with thigh-fixed accelerometers, is a key risk factor for muscle atrophy in neurocritical care patients. Quantifiable biomarkers reflecting the level of activity can support more precise phenotyping of ICUAW and may direct tailored interventions to support activity in the ICU. Studies addressing the external validity of these findings beyond the neurointensive care unit are warranted.

METHODS: Using NHANES 2017-2020 data, participants over 50âyears old with complete femoral neck BMD data were selected. This cohort was randomly divided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets. Lasso regression selected variables for inclusion in six machine learning models built on the training data: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). NHANES data from the 2013-2014 cycle was used as an external validation set input into the models to verify their generalizability. Model discrimination was assessed via AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score. Calibration curves evaluated goodness-of-fit. Decision curves determined clinical utility. The SHAP framework analyzed variable importance.
RESULTS: A total of 3,545 participants were included in the internal validation set of this study, of whom 1870 had normal bone density and 1,675 had low bone density Lasso regression selected 19 variables. In the test set, AUC was 0.785 (LR), 0.780 (SVM), 0.775 (GBM), 0.729 (NB), 0.771 (ANN), and 0.768 (RF). The LR model has the best discrimination and a better calibration curve fit, the best clinical net benefit for the decision curve, and it also reflects good predictive power in the external validation dataset The top variables in the LR model were: age, BMI, gender, creatine phosphokinase, total cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning model demonstrated effective classification of low BMD using blood biomarkers. This could aid clinical decision making for osteoporosis prevention and management.",computer vision,"['neural network', 'artificial neural network']"

Few ML studies have examined percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) outcomes. Our objective was to build, streamline, temporally validate, and use ML models for prediction of PCNL outcomes (intensive care admission, postoperative infection, transfusion, adjuvant treatment, postoperative complications, visceral injury, and stone-free status at follow-up) using a comprehensive national database (British Association of Urological Surgeons PCNL).
METHODS: This was an ML study using data from a prospective national database. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), deep neural network (DNN), and logistic regression (LR) models were built for each outcome of interest using complete cases only, imputed, and oversampled and imputed/oversampled data sets. All validation was performed with complete cases only. Temporal validation was performed with 2019 data only. A second round used a composite of the most important 11 variables in each model to build the final model for inclusion in the shiny application. We report statistics for prognostic accuracy.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The database contains 12 810 patients. The final variables included were age, Charlson comorbidity index, preoperative haemoglobin, Guy's stone score, stone location, size of outer sheath, preoperative midstream urine result, primary puncture site, preoperative dimercapto-succinic acid scan, stone size, and image guidance (https://endourology.shinyapps.io/PCNL_Demographics/). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was >0.6 in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This is the largest ML study on PCNL outcomes to date. The models are temporally valid and therefore can be implemented in clinical practice for patient-specific risk profiling. Further work will be conducted to externally validate the models.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We applied artificial intelligence to data for patients who underwent a keyhole surgery to remove kidney stones and developed a model to predict outcomes for this procedure. Doctors could use this tool to advise patients about their risk of complications and the outcomes they can expect after this surgery.",computer vision,['neural network']

Therefore, ALDLT must be responsibly performed in the perspective of a positive harm-to-benefit ratio. This study aimed to develop a risk prediction model for early (3 months) graft failure (EGF) following ALDLT. Donor and recipient factors associated with EGF in ALDLT were studied using data from the European Liver Transplant Registry. An artificial neural network classification algorithm was trained on a set of 2073 ALDLTs, validated using cross-validation, tested on an independent random-split sample (n=518), and externally validated on United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research data. Model performance was assessed using the AUC, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Graft type, graft weight, level of hospitalization, and the severity of liver disease were associated with EGF. The model ( http://ldlt.shinyapps.io/eltr_app ) presented AUC values at cross-validation, in the independent test set, and at external validation of 0.69, 0.70, and 0.68, respectively. Model calibration was fair. The decision curve analysis indicated a positive net benefit of the model, with an estimated net reduction of 5-15 EGF per 100 ALDLTs. Estimated risks>40% and<5% had a specificity of 0.96 and sensitivity of 0.99 in predicting and excluding EGF, respectively. The model also stratified long-term graft survival ( p <0.001), which ranged from 87% in the low-risk group to 60% in the high-risk group. In conclusion, based on a panel of donor and recipient variables, an artificial neural network can contribute to decision-making in ALDLT by predicting EGF risk.",computer vision,"['dl', 'neural network', 'artificial neural network']"

Diverse and robust radiomics features can be identified that may be of aid in the accurate quantification e.g. varying degrees of sarcopenia in respective muscles of large cohorts. As such, the approach comprises the texture feature extraction from raw data based on well established approaches, such as a nnU-Net neural network and the Pyradiomics toolbox, a subsequent selection according to adequate conditions for the muscle tissue of the general population, and an importance-based ranking to further narrow the amount of meaningful features with respect to auxiliary targets. The performance was investigated with respect to the included auxiliary targets, namely age, body mass index (BMI), and fat fraction (FF). Four skeletal muscles with different fiber architecture were included: the mm. glutaei, m. psoas, as well as the extensors and adductors of the thigh. The selection allowed for a reduction from 1015 available texture features to 65 for age, 53 for BMI, and 36 for FF from the available fat/water contrast images considering all muscles jointly. Further, the dependence of the importance rankings calculated for the auxiliary targets on validation sets (in a cross-validation scheme) was investigated by boxplots. In addition, significant differences between subgroups of respective auxiliary targets as well as between both sexes were shown to be present within the ten lowest ranked features by means of Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests. The prediction performance for the selected features and the ranking scheme were verified on validation sets by a random forest based multi-class classification, with strong area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) of 73.03 Â± 0.70 % and 73.63 Â± 0.70 % for the water and fat images in age, 80.68 Â± 0.30 % and 88.03 Â± 0.89 % in BMI, as well as 98.36 Â± 0.03 % and 98.52 Â± 0.09 % in FF.",computer vision,['neural network']

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of an automated machine-learning model in the identification of patients at high risk of adverse outcomes from surgery using only data in the electronic health record.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study was conducted among 1â¯477â¯561 patients undergoing surgery at 20 community and tertiary care hospitals in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) health network. The study included 3 phases: (1) building and validating a model on a retrospective population, (2) testing model accuracy on a retrospective population, and (3) validating the model prospectively in clinical care. A gradient-boosted decision tree machine learning method was used for developing a preoperative surgical risk prediction tool. The Shapley additive explanations method was used for model interpretability and further validation. Accuracy was compared between the UPMC model and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) surgical risk calculator for predicting mortality. Data were analyzed from September through December 2021.
EXPOSURE: Undergoing any type of surgical procedure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) at 30 days were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 1â¯477â¯561 patients included in model development (806â¯148 females [54.5%; mean [SD] age, 56.8 [17.9] years), 1â¯016â¯966 patient encounters were used for training and 254â¯242 separate encounters were used for testing the model. After deployment in clinical use, another 206â¯353 patients were prospectively evaluated; an additional 902 patients were selected for comparing the accuracy of the UPMC model and NSQIP tool for predicting mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for mortality was 0.972 (95% CI, 0.971-0.973) for the training set and 0.946 (95% CI, 0.943-0.948) for the test set. The AUROC for MACCE and mortality was 0.923 (95% CI, 0.922-0.924) on the training and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) on the test set. In prospective evaluation, the AUROC for mortality was 0.956 (95% CI, 0.953-0.959), sensitivity was 2148 of 2517 patients (85.3%), specificity was 186â¯286 of 203â¯836 patients (91.4%), and negative predictive value was 186â¯286 of 186â¯655 patients (99.8%). The model outperformed the NSQIP tool as measured by AUROC (0.945 [95% CI, 0.914-0.977] vs 0.897 [95% CI, 0.854-0.941], for a difference of 0.048), specificity (0.87 [95% CI, 0.83-0.89] vs 0.68 [95% CI, 0.65-0.69]), and accuracy (0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87] vs 0.69 [95% CI, 0.66, 0.72]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that an automated machine learning model was accurate in identifying patients undergoing surgery who were at high risk of adverse outcomes using only preoperative variables within the electronic health record, with superior performance compared with the NSQIP calculator. These findings suggest that using this model to identify patients at increased risk of adverse outcomes prior to surgery may allow for individualized perioperative care, which may be associated with improved outcomes.",computer vision,[]

The two groups were matched in terms of sex, education and age. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from all participants to analyze the fraction amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) to assess regional and neural network alterations in the brain. Correlations between fALFF/FC values in specific brain regions and clinical characteristics were also examined. The results showed increased fALFF values in the bilateral calcarine gyrus, bilateral superior occipital gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and left cuneus in the HIV-NCI group compared to the HIV-control group. Additionally, increased FC values were observed between the right superior occipital gyrus and right olfactory cortex, bilateral gyrus rectus, and right orbital part of the middle frontal gyrus in the HIV-NCI group. Conversely, decreased FC values were found between the left hippocampus and bilateral medial prefrontal gyrus, as well as bilateral superior frontal gyrus. The study concluded that abnormal spontaneous activity in PLWH with NCI primarily occurred in the occipital cortex, while defects in brain networks were mostly associated with the prefrontal cortex. The observed changes in fALFF and FC in specific brain regions provide visual evidence to enhance our understanding of the central mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive impairment in HIV patients.",computer vision,"['dl', 'visual', 'neural network']"

It is unclear if intraoperative data add significant value to these risk prediction models.
METHODS: With IRB approval, an institutional retrospective cohort of intra-abdominal surgery patients in the 2005 to 2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was identified. Intraoperative data were obtained from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms to predict 30-day mortality using: 1) baseline variables and 2) baseline + intraoperative variables. Algorithms evaluated were: 1) logistic regression with elastic net selection, 2) random forest (RF), 3) gradient boosting machine (GBM), 4) support vector machine (SVM), and 5) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The sample was randomly divided into a training/testing split with 80%/20% probabilities. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation identified the optimal model hyperparameters in the training dataset for each model, which were then applied to the entire training dataset to train the model. Trained models were applied to the test cohort to evaluate model performance. Statistical significance was evaluated using P < .05.
RESULTS: The training and testing cohorts contained 4322 and 1079 patients, respectively, with 62 (1.4%) and 15 (1.4%) experiencing 30-day mortality, respectively. When using only baseline variables to predict mortality, all algorithms except SVM (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.83 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.69-0.97]) had AUROC >0.9: GBM (AUROC, 0.96 [0.94-1.0]), RF (AUROC, 0.96 [0.92-1.0]), CNN (AUROC, 0.96 [0.92-0.99]), and logistic regression (AUROC, 0.95 [0.91-0.99]). AUROC significantly increased with intraoperative variables with CNN (AUROC, 0.97 [0.96-0.99]; P = .047 versus baseline), but there was no improvement with GBM (AUROC, 0.97 [0.95-0.99]; P = .3 versus baseline), RF (AUROC, 0.96 [0.93-1.0]; P = .5 versus baseline), and logistic regression (AUROC, 0.94 [0.90-0.99]; P = .6 versus baseline).
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative mortality is predicted with excellent discrimination in intra-abdominal surgery patients using only preoperative variables in various machine learning algorithms. The addition of intraoperative data to preoperative data also resulted in models with excellent discrimination, but model performance did not improve.",computer vision,"['dl', 'neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'convolutional neural network']"

Despite careful screening, it remains difficult to determine severity of alpha-synucleinopathy involvement which influences the risk of postoperative complications including cognitive deterioration. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) reflects cognitive dysfunction in PD and may provide biomarkers of postoperative cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an automated machine learning model based on preoperative EEG data to predict cognitive deterioration 1âyear after STN DBS.
METHODS: Sixty DBS candidates were included; 42 patients had available preoperative EEGs to compute a fully automated machine learning model. Movement Disorder Society criteria classified patients as cognitively stable or deteriorated at 1-year follow-up. A total of 16,674 EEG-features were extracted per patient; a Boruta algorithm selected EEG-features to reflect representative neurophysiological signatures for each class. A random forest classifier with 10-fold cross-validation with Bayesian optimization provided class-differentiation.
RESULTS: Tweny-five patients were classified as cognitively stable and 17 patients demonstrated cognitive decline. The model differentiated classes with a mean (SD) accuracy of 0.88 (0.05), with a positive predictive value of 91.4% (95% CI 82.9, 95.9) and negative predictive value of 85.0% (95% CI 81.9, 91.4). Predicted probabilities between classes were highly differential (hazard ratio 11.14 [95% CI 7.25, 17.12]); the risk of cognitive decline in patients with high probabilities of being prognosticated as cognitively stable (>0.5) was very limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative EEGs can predict cognitive deterioration after STN DBS with high accuracy. Cortical neurophysiological alterations may indicate future cognitive decline and can be used as biomarkers during the DBS screening. Â© 2021 The Authors.

Our aim was to investigate whether the severity of chest imaging findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates with the risk of acute neuroimaging findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 who received care at our hospital between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, and underwent chest imaging within 10 days of neuroimaging. Chest radiographs were assessed using a previously validated automated neural network algorithm for COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity score). Chest CTs were graded using a Chest CT Severity scoring system based on involvement of each lobe. Associations between chest imaging severity scores and acute neuroimaging findings were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Twenty-four of 93 patients (26%) included in the study had positive acute neuroimaging findings, including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 7), infarction (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), or a combination of findings (n = 4). The average length of hospitalization, prevalence of intensive care unit admission, and proportion of patients requiring intubation were significantly greater in patients with acute neuroimaging findings than in patients without them (P &lt; .05 for all). Compared with patients without acute neuroimaging findings, patients with acute neuroimaging findings had significantly higher mean Pulmonary X-ray Severity scores (5.0 [SD, 2.9] versus 9.2 [SD, 3.4], P &lt; .001) and mean Chest CT Severity scores (9.0 [SD, 5.1] versus 12.1 [SD, 5.0], P = .041). The pulmonary x-ray severity score was a significant predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and acute neuroimaging findings had more severe findings on chest imaging on both radiographs and CT compared with patients with COVID-19 without acute neuroimaging findings. The severity of findings on chest radiography was a strong predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.",computer vision,['neural network']

It is strongly associated with major adverse events, which in turn leads to increased cost and poor outcomes (eg, need for nursing home due to cognitive impairment, stroke, and death). The ability to foresee patients at risk of delirium will guide the timely initiation of multimodal preventive interventions, which will aid in reducing the burden and negative consequences associated with delirium. Several studies have focused on the prediction of delirium. However, the number of studies in cardiac surgical patients that have used machine learning methods is very limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the application of several machine learning predictive models that can pre-emptively predict delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and compare their performance.
METHODS: We investigated a number of machine learning methods to develop models that can predict delirium after cardiac surgery. A clinical dataset comprising over 5000 actual patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a single center was used to develop the models using logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Bayesian belief networks (BBN), naÃ¯ve Bayesian, random forest, and decision trees.
RESULTS: Only 507 out of 5584 patients (11.4%) developed delirium. We addressed the underlying class imbalance, using random undersampling, in the training dataset. The final prediction performance was validated on a separate test dataset. Owing to the target class imbalance, several measures were used to evaluate algorithm's performance for the delirium class on the test dataset. Out of the selected algorithms, the SVM algorithm had the best F1 score for positive cases, kappa, and positive predictive value (40.2%, 29.3%, and 29.7%, respectively) with a P=.01, .03, .02, respectively. The ANN had the best receiver-operator area-under the curve (78.2%; P=.03). The BBN had the best precision-recall area-under the curve for detecting positive cases (30.4%; P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Although delirium is inherently complex, preventive measures to mitigate its negative effect can be applied proactively if patients at risk are prospectively identified. Our results highlight 2 important points: (1) addressing class imbalance on the training dataset will augment machine learning model's performance in identifying patients likely to develop postoperative delirium, and (2) as the prediction of postoperative delirium is difficult because it is multifactorial and has complex pathophysiology, applying machine learning methods (complex or simple) may improve the prediction by revealing hidden patterns, which will lead to cost reduction by prevention of complications and will optimize patients' outcomes.",computer vision,"['neural network', 'artificial neural network', 'multimodal']"

This study was conducted to define the minimum number of days of growth data and the type of ANN required for the best prediction of PHS susceptibility. Four experiments were conducted in which broilers were weighed daily at 0800 h. In Experiment 1, Hubbard male broilers were reared to 50 d of age, with 13 developing PHS and 33 remaining normal (N), for a PHS:N ratio of 13:33. In Experiment 2, ANAK broilers were exposed to cool temperatures (16 to 17 C) from 17 to 42 d of age, resulting in a PHS:N ratio of 16:46 for males. In Experiments 3 and 4, Hubbard male and female chicks from a base population and a PHS-resistant line were exposed to cool temperatures from 17 to 42 d (Experiment 3) or 49 d of age (Experiment 4). The PHS:N ratios were 40:68 for males and 6:96 for females in Experiment 3 and 26:91 for males and 10:58 for females in Experiment 4. Four ANN, back propagation (BP3), Ward back propagation (WardBP), probabilistic (PNN), and general regression (GRNN), were evaluated for their ability to predict PHS in the shortest number of days based on daily growth velocities (BWd+1-BWd). A 100% prediction of PHS and N birds was considered the criterion of success. Starting with 14 d of data, each ANN was trained on daily growth velocity, and the number of predictive days was reduced with each run of the ANN. The best ANN was a GRNN, which correctly diagnosed PHS and N male broilers on 4 and 6 d of growth velocity data for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. The results were poorer with the BP3, WardBP, and PNN. The diagnostic ability of the neural network was not consistent over all four experiments. In Experiment 2, a minimum of 6 d was required for 100% PHS detection for males. In Experiment 3, the best diagnostic value for males was 93% PHS detection and 100% N detection at 15 d. For females, the 100% PHS detection occurred at a minimum of 8 d. In Experiment 4, males had 100% PHS and N detection at a minimum of 11 d. Females had a 100% PHS and N detection at a minimum of 10 d. An attempt to build a single neural network that would detect PHS susceptibility in Hubbard (Experiment 1) and ANAK (Experiment 2) broilers was unsuccessful. The application (validation) of neural networks between experiments also was not successful (data not presented). However, these studies demonstrate that within a breed or line reared under similar selection pressures for ascites, a GRNN based on the first 14 d of growth velocity can detect, with at least 93% accuracy, broilers susceptible to PHS.",computer vision,"['neural network', 'artificial neural network']"
39059888,The diagnostic and triage accuracy of the GPT-3 artificial intelligence model: an observational study,"Levine DM, Tuwani R, Kompa B, Varma A, Finlayson SG, Mehrotra A, Beam A.",Lancet Digit Health. 2024 Aug;6(8):e555-e561. doi: 10.1016/S2589-7500(24)00097-9.,Levine DM,Lancet Digit Health,2024,2024/07/26,,,10.1016/S2589-7500(24)00097-9,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health care have been effective in many areas of medicine, but they are often trained for a single task using labelled data, making deployment and generalisability challenging. How well a general-purpose AI language model performs diagnosis and triage relative to physicians and laypeople is not well understood.
METHODS: We compared the predictive accuracy of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)'s diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated synthetic case vignettes (<50 words; sixth-grade reading level or below) of both common (eg, viral illness) and severe (eg, heart attack) conditions to a nationally representative sample of 5000 lay people from the USA who could use the internet to find the correct options and 21 practising physicians at Harvard Medical School. There were 12 vignettes for each of four triage categories: emergent, within one day, within 1 week, and self-care. The correct diagnosis and triage category (ie, ground truth) for each vignette was determined by two general internists at Harvard Medical School. For each vignette, human respondents and GPT-3 were prompted to list diagnoses in order of likelihood, and the vignette was marked as correct if the ground-truth diagnosis was in the top three of the listed diagnoses. For triage accuracy, we examined whether the human respondents' and GPT-3's selected triage was exactly correct according to the four triage categories, or matched a dichotomised triage variable (emergent or within 1 day vs within 1 week or self-care). We estimated GPT-3's diagnostic and triage confidence on a given vignette using a modified bootstrap resampling procedure, and examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was by computing calibration curves and Brier scores. We also performed subgroup analysis by case acuity, and an error analysis for triage advice to characterise how its advice might affect patients using this tool to decide if they should seek medical care immediately.
FINDINGS: Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top three for 88% (42/48, 95% CI 75-94) of cases, compared with 54% (2700/5000, 53-55) for lay individuals (p<0.0001) and 96% (637/666, 94-97) for physicians (p=0Â·012). GPT-3 triaged 70% correct (34/48, 57-82) versus 74% (3706/5000, 73-75; p=0.60) for lay individuals and 91% (608/666, 89-93%; p<0.0001) for physicians. As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score=0Â·18) and triage (Brier score=0Â·22). We observed an inverse relationship between case acuity and GPT-3 accuracy (p<0Â·0001) with a fitted trend line of -8Â·33% decrease in accuracy for every level of increase in case acuity. For triage error analysis, GPT-3 deprioritised truly emergent cases in seven instances.
INTERPRETATION: A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below, physicians and better than lay individuals. We found that GPT-3's performance was inferior to physicians for triage, sometimes by a large margin, and its performance was closer to that of lay individuals. Although the diagnostic performance of GPT-3 was comparable to physicians, it was significantly better than a typical person using a search engine.
