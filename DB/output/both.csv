The purpose of this publication is to analyze the impact of working with screen-monitor devices on computer vision syndromes, musculoskeletal disorders, circadian rhythm, and to identify recommendations for the proper organization of the home office. A narrative review of the existing literature on the impact of work with the use of devices equipped with screen monitors on the health of employees was performed, as well as recommendations in the above-mentioned area were presented. The most important factors determining the load on the visual organs and musculoskeletal system and affecting the overall health and well-being of employees during remote work are the proper arrangement of the workstation (in accordance with ergonomic principles) and the organization of work (limiting the time spent working at the computer/laptop, systematic active breaks) and healthy sleep habits. It is crucial that both employers, occupational health professionals and employees themselves are aware of the importance to their health of correct preparation of the home office, and have adequate knowledge in this regard.

However, previous deep learning studies have utilized single-center data and limited acquisition parameters.
PURPOSE: Develop a generalizable CNN for lung segmentation in 1 H-MRI, robust to pathology, acquisition protocol, vendor, and center.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: A total of 809 1 H-MRI scans from 258 participants with various pulmonary pathologies (median age (range): 57 (6-85); 42% females) and 31 healthy participants (median age (range): 34 (23-76); 34% females) that were split into training (593 scans (74%); 157 participants (55%)), testing (50 scans (6%); 50 participants (17%)) and external validation (164 scans (20%); 82 participants (28%)) sets.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5-T and 3-T/3D spoiled-gradient recalled and ultrashort echo-time 1 H-MRI.
ASSESSMENT: 2D and 3D CNNs, trained on single-center, multi-sequence data, and the conventional spatial fuzzy c-means (SFCM) method were compared to manually delineated expert segmentations. Each method was validated on external data originating from several centers. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average boundary Hausdorff distance (Average HD), and relative error (XOR) metrics to assess segmentation performance.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed significances of differences between acquisitions in the testing set. Friedman tests with post hoc multiple comparisons assessed differences between the 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and SFCM. Bland-Altman analyses assessed agreement with manually derived lung volumes. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The 3D CNN significantly outperformed its 2D analog and SFCM, yielding a median (range) DSC of 0.961 (0.880-0.987), Average HD of 1.63âmm (0.65-5.45) and XOR of 0.079 (0.025-0.240) on the testing set and a DSC of 0.973 (0.866-0.987), Average HD of 1.11âmm (0.47-8.13) and XOR of 0.054 (0.026-0.255) on external validation data.
DATA CONCLUSION: The 3D CNN generated accurate 1 H-MRI lung segmentations on a heterogenous dataset, demonstrating robustness to disease pathology, sequence, vendor, and center.

These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and result in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies.
METHODS: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions.
RESULTS: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels.
CONCLUSION: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.",both,"['image processing', 'image processing']"

Epub 2020 Dec 25.,Haenssle HA,Eur J Cancer,2021,2020/12/28,,,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.11.034,"BACKGROUND: The clinical differentiation of face and scalp lesions (FSLs) is challenging even for trained dermatologists. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with dermatologists in FSL are lacking.
METHODS: A market-approved CNN (Moleanalyzer-Pro, FotoFinder Systems) was used for binary classifications of 100 dermoscopic images of FSL. The same lesions were used in a two-level reader study including 64 dermatologists (level I: dermoscopy only; level II: dermoscopy, clinical close-up images, textual information). Primary endpoints were the CNN's sensitivity and specificity in comparison with the dermatologists' management decisions in level II. Generalizability of the CNN results was tested by using four additional external data sets.
RESULTS: The CNN's sensitivity, specificityÂ and ROC AUC were 96.2% [87.0%-98.9%], 68.8% [54.7%-80.1%]Â and 0.929 [0.880-0.978], respectively. In level II, the dermatologists' management decisions showed a mean sensitivity of 84.2% [82.2%-86.2%] and specificity of 69.4% [66.0%-72.8%]. When fixing the CNN's specificity at the dermatologists' mean specificity (69.4%), the CNN's sensitivity (96.2% [87.0%-98.9%]) was significantly higher than that of dermatologists (84.2% [82.2%-86.2%]; pÂ <Â 0.001). Dermatologists of all training levels were outperformed by the CNN (all pÂ <Â 0.001). In confirmation, the CNN's accuracy (83.0%) was significantly higher than dermatologists' accuracies in level II management decisions (all pÂ <Â 0.001). The CNN's performance was largely confirmed in three additional external data sets but particularly showed a reduced specificity in one Australian data set including FSL on severely sun-damaged skin.
CONCLUSIONS: When applied as an assistant system, the CNN's higher sensitivity at an equivalent specificity may result in an improved early detection of face and scalp skin cancers.",both,"['dl', 'neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'convolutional neural network']"

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the lockdown on digital device usage, and consequently, the ocular surface health implications and circadian rhythm abnormalities related to digital eye strain.
METHODS: An open online survey was sent through various social media platforms and was open for a period of 2 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 407 usable responses were obtained; the average age of respondents was 27.4 years. Typically, 93.6% of respondents reported an increase in their screen time since the lockdown was declared. The average increase in digital device usage was calculated at about 4.8 Â± 2.8 h per day. The total usage per day was found to be 8.65 Â± 3.74 hours. Sleep disturbances have been reported by 62.4% of people. Typically, 95.8% of respondents had experienced at least one symptom related to digital device usage, and 56.5% said that the frequency and intensity of these symptoms increased since the lockdown was declared.
CONCLUSION: The study highlighted the drastic increase in use of digital devices after the initiation of the COVID-19 lockdown, and along with it, the slow deterioration of ocular health across all age groups. Awareness about prevention of digital eye strain should be stressed, and going forward, measures to bring these adverse effects to a minimum should be explored.",both,['visual']

METHODS: In 2,011 patients (49.7% female, median age 73 years [61-81]) included between 2009 and 2017, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses regarding the occurrence of FR. FRs were defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 4-6 despite successful recanalization in patients selected by MRI (n = 690) and CT (n = 1,321) with a sensitivity analysis considering only patients with mRS 5-6 as futile.
RESULTS: MRI as compared to CT resulted in similar rates of subsequent MT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.048, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.677-1.624). Rates of FR were as follows: 571/1,489 (38%) FR mRS 4-6 including 393/1,489 (26%) FR mRS 5-6. CT-based selection was associated with increased rates of FRs compared to MRI (44% [41%-47%] vs 29% [25%-32%], p &lt; 0.001; aOR 1.77 [95% CI 1.25-2.51]). These findings were robust in sensitivity analysis. MRI-selected patients had a delay of approximately 30 minutes in workflow metrics in real-world university comprehensive stroke centers. However, functional outcome and mortality were more favorable in patients selected by MRI compared to patients selected with CT.
CONCLUSIONS: CT selection for MT was associated with an increased risk of FRs as compared to MRI selection. Efforts are needed to shorten workflow delays in MRI patients. Further research is needed to clarify the role of the initial imaging modality on FR occurrence and to develop a reliable FR prediction algorithm.",both,['dl']

METHODS: This pivotal phase III randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of upfront combination of VB-111 and bevacizumab versus bevacizumab monotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive VB-111 1013 viral particles every 8 weeks in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (combination arm) or bevacizumab monotherapy (control arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: Enrolled were 256 patients at 57 sites. Median exposure to VB-111 was 4 months. The study did not meet its primary or secondary goals. Median OS was 6.8 versus 7.9 months in the combination versus control arm (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI: 0.91-1.59; Pâ=â0.19) and ORR was 27.3% versus 21.9% (Pâ=â0.26). A higher rate of grades 3-5 adverse events was reported in the combination arm (67% vs 40%), mainly attributed to a higher rate of CNS and flu-like/fever events. Trends for improved survival with combination treatment were seen in the subgroup of patients with smaller tumors and in patients who had a posttreatment febrile reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, upfront concomitant administration of VB-111 and bevacizumab failed to improve outcomes in rGBM. Change of treatment regimen, with the lack of VB-111 monotherapy priming, may explain the differences from the favorable phase II results.

Previous results from the GREPONET study showed that TGR measured after 3 months (TGR<sub>3m</sub>) of starting systemic treatment (ST) or watch and wait (WW) was an early biomarker predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in neuroendocrine tumors (NET).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients from 7 centers with advanced grade (G) 1/2 NETs from the pancreas (P)/small bowel (SB) initiating ST/WW were eligible. Computed tomography (CT)/MRI performed at prebaseline, baseline, and 3(Â±1) months of study entry were retrospectively reviewed. Aim-1: explore treatment-induced changes in TGR (ÎTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub>; paired T test), and Aim-2: validate TGR<sub>3m</sub> (&lt;0.8%/m vs. â¥0.8%/m) as an early biomarker in an independent cohort (Kaplan-Meier/Cox regression).
RESULTS: Of 785 patients screened, 127 were eligible. Mean (SD) TGR<sub>0</sub> and TGR<sub>3m</sub> were 5.4%/m (14.9) and -1.4%/m (11.8), respectively. Mean (SD) ÎTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub> paired-difference was -6.8%/m (19.3; P &lt; 0.001). Most marked ÎTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub> [mean (SD)] were identified with targeted therapies [-11.3%/m (4.7); P = 0.0237] and chemotherapy [-7.9%/m (3.4); P = 0.0261]. Multivariable analysis confirmed the absence of previous treatment (OR = 4.65; 95% CI, 1.31-16.52; P = 0.018) and low TGR<sub>3m</sub> (continuous variable; OR 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19; P = 0.042) to be independent predictors of radiologic objective response. When the multivariable survival analysis for PFS (Cox regression) was adjusted to grade (P = 0.004) and stage (P = 0.017), TGR<sub>3m</sub> â¥ 0.8 (vs. &lt;0.8) maintained its significance as a prognostic factor (P &lt; 0.001), whereas TGR<sub>0</sub> and ÎTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub> did not.

Epub 2019 Jun 26.,Zhai TT,Oral Oncol,2019,2019/07/27,,,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2019.06.020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether quantitative CT image-biomarkers (IBMs) can improve the prediction models with only classical prognostic factors for local-control (LC), regional-control (RC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cohort included 240 and 204 HNC patients in the training and validation analysis, respectively. Clinical variables were scored prospectively and IBMs of the primary tumor and lymph nodes were extracted from planning CT-images. Clinical, IBM and combined models were created from multivariable Cox proportional-hazard analyses based on clinical features, IBMs, and both for LC, RC, DMFS and DFS.
RESULTS: Clinical variables identified in the multivariable analysis included tumor-site, WHO performance-score, tumor-stage and age. Bounding-box-volume describing the tumor volume and irregular shape, IBM correlation representing radiological heterogeneity, and LN_major-axis-length showing the distance between lymph nodes were included in the IBM models. The performance of IBM LC, RC, DMFS and DFS models (c-index(validated):0.62, 0.80, 0.68 and 0.65) were comparable to that of the clinical models (0.62, 0.76, 0.70 and 0.66). The combined DFS model (0.70) including clinical features and IBMs performed significantly better than the clinical model. Patients stratified with the combined models revealed larger differences between risk groups in the validation cohort than with clinical models for LC, RC and DFS. For DMFS, the differences were similar to the clinical model.

Demonstrating that such treatments are effective requires accurate knowledge of when symptoms would have started without treatment. Familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration offers a unique opportunity to develop predictors of symptom onset.
METHODS: We created dementia risk scores in 268 familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration family members by entering covariate-adjusted standardized estimates of brain atrophy into a logistic regression to classify asymptomatic versus demented participants. The score's predictive value was tested in a separate group who were followed up longitudinally (stable vs. converted to dementia) using Cox proportional regressions with dementia risk score as the predictor.
RESULTS: Cross-validated logistic regression achieved good separation of asymptomatic versus demented (accuracyÂ =Â 90%, SEÂ =Â 0.06). Atrophy scores predicted conversion from asymptomatic or mildly/questionably symptomatic to dementia (HRÂ =Â 1.51, 95% CI: [1.16,1.98]).
DISCUSSION: Individualized quantification of baseline brain atrophy is a promising predictor of progression in asymptomatic familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration mutation carriers.",both,"['dl', 'vision', 'generative']"

The characteristic facial dysmorphisms include microcephaly, arched eyebrows, synophrys, short nose with depressed bridge and anteverted nares, long philtrum, thin lips, micrognathia, and hypertrichosis. Most affected individuals have intellectual disability, growth deficiency, and upper limb anomalies. This study looked at individuals from diverse populations with both clinical and molecularly confirmed diagnoses of CdLS by facial analysis technology. Clinical data and images from 246 individuals with CdLS were obtained from 15 countries. This cohort included 49% female patients and ages ranged from infancy to 37âyears. Individuals were grouped into ancestry categories of African descent, Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Caucasian. Across these populations, 14 features showed a statistically significant difference. The most common facial features found in all ancestry groups included synophrys, short nose with anteverted nares, and a long philtrum with thin vermillion of the upper lip. Using facial analysis technology we compared 246 individuals with CdLS to 246 gender/age matched controls and found that sensitivity was equal or greater than 95% for all groups. Specificity was equal or greater than 91%. In conclusion, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with CdLS while demonstrating how facial analysis technology can be a tool to support accurate diagnoses in the clinical setting. This work, along with prior studies in this arena, will assist in earlier detection, recognition, and treatment of CdLS worldwide.",both,['dl']

Understanding the association between amyloid aggregation and cognitive manifestation in persons without dementia is important for a better understanding of the course of AD and for the design of prevention trials.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether amyloid-Î² aggregation is associated with cognitive functioning in persons without dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 2908 participants with normal cognition and 4133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from 53 studies in the multicenter Amyloid Biomarker Study. Normal cognition was defined as having no cognitive concerns for which medical help was sought and scores within the normal range on cognitive tests. Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed according to published criteria. Study inclusion began in 2013 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed in January 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Global cognitive performance as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and episodic memory performance as assessed by a verbal word learning test. Amyloid aggregation was measured with positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and dichotomized as negative (normal) or positive (abnormal) according to study-specific cutoffs. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between amyloid aggregation and low cognitive scores (MMSE score â¤27 or memory z scoreâ¤-1.28) and to assess whether this association was moderated by age, sex, educational level, or apolipoprotein E genotype.
RESULTS: Among 2908 persons with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [12.8] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory scores after age 70 years (mean difference in amyloid positive vs negative, 4% [95% CI, 0%-7%] at 72 years and 21% [95% CI, 10%-33%] at 90 years) but was not associated with low MMSE scores (mean difference, 3% [95% CI, -1% to 6%], Pâ=â.16). Among 4133 patients with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.5] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory (mean difference, 16% [95% CI, 12%-20%], Pâ<â.001) and low MMSE (mean difference, 14% [95% CI, 12%-17%], Pâ<â.001) scores, and this association decreased with age. Low cognitive scores had limited utility for screening of amyloid positivity in persons with normal cognition and those with MCI. In persons with normal cognition, the age-related increase in low memory score paralleled the age-related increase in amyloid positivity with an intervening period of 10 to 15 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although low memory scores are an early marker of amyloid positivity, their value as a screening measure for early AD among persons without dementia is limited.",both,['dl']

METHODS: FDG-PET/CT indices and clinicopathological parameters were assessed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). After completion of chemotherapy, all patients had breast surgery with axillary lymph node dissection, followed by radiation therapy and endocrine therapy for 5Â years. EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-three consecutive patients with stage II-III ER+/HER2- BC and without distant metastases at baseline PET were included. High standardized uptake values (SUVs), were associated with shorter EFS (HRâ=â3.51, Pâ&lt;â0.01 for SUV<sub>max</sub>; HRâ=â2.76, Pâ=â0.02 for SUV<sub>mean</sub>; and HRâ=â4.40 Pâ&lt;â0.01 for SUV<sub>peak</sub>). Metabolically active tumor volume (MATV, HRâ=â3.47, Pâ&lt;â0.01) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG, HRâ=â3.10, Pâ&lt;â0.01) were also predictive of EFS. Homogeneity was not predictive (HRâ=â2.27, Pâ=â0.07) and entropy had weak prediction (HRâ=â2.89, Pâ=â0.02). Among clinicopathological parameters, EFS was shorter in progesterone receptor (PR)-negative tumor (vs. PR-positive tumor; HRâ=â3.25, Pâ&lt;â0.01); histology was predictive of EFS (lobular vs. ductal invasive carcinoma; HRâ=â3.74, Pâ=â0.01) but not tumor grade (grade 3 vs. grade 1-2; HRâ=â1.64, Pâ=â0.32). Pathological complete response after NAC was not correlated to the risk of relapse. Three parameters remained significantly associated with EFS in multivariate analysis. MATV (HRâ=â1.01, Pâ&lt;â0.01), progesterone receptor expression (HRâ=â2.90, Pâ=â0.03) and tumor histology (HRâ=â3.80, Pâ=â0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline PET parameters measured before neoadjuvant treatment have prognostic values in ER+/HER2- locally advanced breast cancer patients. After multivariate analysis, metabolically active tumor volume remains significant while textural analysis of PET images is not of added value. Considering histopathological parameters, our study shows that patients with PR-negative or lobular invasive tumor have poorer prognosis than patients with PR-positive or ductal carcinoma, respectively.",both,[]

DESIGN: Cross-sectional brain Magnetic Resonance I (MRI) study.
SETTING: Community based cohort in three U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A Caucasian and African-American sub-sample (n= 680; mean age 50.3 yrs) attending the 25 year follow-up exam of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: 3T brain MR images processed for quantitative estimates of: total brain (TBV) and abnormal white matter (AWM) volume; white matter fractional anisotropy (WM-FA); and gray matter cerebral blood flow (GM-CBF). Total intracranial volume is TBV plus cerebral spinal fluid (TICV). A Global Cognitive Function (GCF) score was derived from tests of speed, memory and executive function.
RESULTS: Adjusting for TICV and demographic factors, current smoking was significantly associated with lower GM-CBF and TBV, and more AWM (all <0.05); SA with lower GM-CBF, WM-FA and TBV (p=0.01); increasing BMI with decreasing GM-CBF (p<0003); hypertension with lower GM-CBF, WM-FA, and TBV and higher AWM (all <0.05); and diabetes with lower TBV (p=0.007). The GCS was lower as TBV decreased, AWM increased, and WM-FA (all p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: In middle age adults, CVRF are associated with brain health, reflected in MRI measures of structure and perfusion, and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest markers of mid-life cardiovascular and brain health should be considered as indication for early intervention and future risk of late-life cerebrovascular disease and dementia.",both,['dl']

Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of normal squamous epithelium, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and carcinoma were scanned in a TV microscope system and analyzed by means of image processing methods on a DEC 5000/200 workstation. From the 15-20 microns thick histological sections, 3-5 focus positions in steps of 1-4 microns were scanned. The segmentation of the cell nuclei was performed automatically by color analysis and geometric operations. For each nucleus the best focus level was selected and at this level the center of the cell was calculated. Graph theoretical methods were applied to analyze the morphometry of the epithelium specimens. The minimal spanning tree was computed in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the sections with the selected centers of the nuclei as vertices. The best feature found for discrimination of the specimens is the average length of all edges in a tree. In the two-dimensional (2D) analysis we had to accept an error probability of about 20% in differentiation of dysplasia and carcinoma.

The predictive performance of this model was compared with the international prognostic index (IPI) and 2 models incorporating radiomic PET/CT features (clinical PET and PET models). Methods: In total, 1,132 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients were included: 296 for training and 836 for external validation. The primary outcome was 2-y time to progression. The deep learning model was trained on maximum-intensity projections from PET/CT scans. The clinical PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, SUV<sub>peak</sub>, age, and performance status. The PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, and SUV<sub>peak</sub> Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: The IPI yielded an AUC of 0.60 on all external data. The deep learning model yielded a significantly higher AUC of 0.66 (P &lt; 0.01). For each individual clinical trial, the model was consistently better than IPI. Radiomic model AUCs remained higher for all clinical trials. The deep learning and clinical PET models showed equivalent performance (AUC, 0.69; P &gt; 0.05). The PET model yielded the highest AUC of all models (AUC, 0.71; P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The deep learning model predicted outcome in all trials with a higher performance than IPI and better survival curve separation. This model can predict treatment outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without tumor delineation but at the cost of a lower prognostic performance than with radiomics.",both,['deep learning']

Materials and Methods The deep learning algorithm was trained using 123â248 two-dimensional digital mammograms (6161 cancers) and a retrospective study was performed on three nonoverlapping datasets of 14â831 screening mammography examinations (1026 cancers) from two U.S. institutions and one U.K. institution (2008-2017). The stand-alone performance of humans and AI was compared. Human plus AI performance was simulated to examine reductions in the cancer detection rate, number of examinations, false-positive callbacks, and benign biopsies. Metrics were adjusted to mimic the natural distribution of a screening population, and bootstrapped CIs and P values were calculated. Results Retrospective evaluation on all datasets showed minimal changes to the cancer detection rate with use of the AI device (noninferiority margin of 0.25 cancers per 1000 examinations: U.S. dataset 1, P = .02; U.S. dataset 2, P &lt; .001; U.K. dataset, P &lt; .001). On U.S. dataset 1 (11â592 mammograms; 101 cancers; 3810 female patients; mean age, 57.3 years Â± 10.0 [SD]), the device reduced screening examinations requiring radiologist interpretation by 41.6% (95% CI: 40.6%, 42.4%; P &lt; .001), diagnostic examinations callbacks by 31.1% (95% CI: 28.7%, 33.4%; P &lt; .001), and benign needle biopsies by 7.4% (95% CI: 4.1%, 12.4%; P &lt; .001). U.S. dataset 2 (1362 mammograms; 330 cancers; 1293 female patients; mean age, 55.4 years Â± 10.5) was reduced by 19.5% (95% CI: 16.9%, 22.1%; P &lt; .001), 11.9% (95% CI: 8.6%, 15.7%; P &lt; .001), and 6.5% (95% CI: 0.0%, 19.0%; P = .08), respectively. The U.K. dataset (1877 mammograms; 595 cancers; 1491 female patients; mean age, 63.5 years Â± 7.1) was reduced by 36.8% (95% CI: 34.4%, 39.7%; P &lt; .001), 17.1% (95% CI: 5.9%, 30.1%: P &lt; .001), and 5.9% (95% CI: 2.9%, 11.5%; P &lt; .001), respectively.

Both proteins share partial overlapping functions in epithelial development and EpCAM expression but have not been comparatively analyzed together in bladder carcinomas. TROP2 constitutes the target for the antibody-drug conjugate Sacituzumab govitecan (SG; TrodelvyTM) which has been approved for treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) irrespective of its TROP2 expression status.
METHODS: To evaluate the potential clinical significance of subtle differences in TROP2 and EpCAM expression in urothelial bladder cancer, both proteins were analyzed by multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry in combination with a deep-learning based algorithm for automated cell detection on more than 2,700 urothelial bladder carcinomas in a tissue microarray (TMA) format.
RESULTS: The staining pattern of TROP2 and EpCAM were highly similar. For both proteins, the staining intensity gradually decreased from pTa G2 low grade (TROP2: 68.8Â±36.1; EpCAM: 21.5Â±11.7) to pTa G2 high grade (64.6Â±38.0; 19.3Â±12.2) and pTa G3 (52.1Â±38.7; 16.0Â±13.0, p<0.001 each). In pT2-4 carcinomas, the average TROP2 and EpCAM staining intensity was intermediate (61.8Â±40.9; 18.3Â±12.3). For both proteins, this was significantly lower than in pTa G2 low grade (p<0.001 each) but also higher than in pTa G3 tumors (p=0.022 for TROP2, p=0.071 for EpCAM). Within pT2-4 carcinomas, the TROP2 and EpCAM staining level was unrelated to pT, grade, UICC-category, and overall or tumor-specific patient survival. The ratio TROP2/EpCAM was unrelated to malignant phenotype and patient prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that TROP2 and EpCAM expression is common and highly interrelated in urothelial neoplasms. Despite of a progressive loss of TROP2/EpCAM during tumor cell dedifferentiation in pTa tumors, the lack of associations with clinicopathological parameters in pT2-4 cancer argues against a major cancer driving role of both proteins for the progression of urothelial neoplasms.",both,"['dl', 'llm']"

In a sample of 4215 adults (PTSD nâ=â1642; Control nâ=â2573) across 40 sites from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD working group, we employed a new state-of-the-art deep-learning based approach for automatic cerebellar parcellation to obtain volumetric estimates for the total cerebellum and 28 subregions. Linear mixed effects models controlling for age, gender, intracranial volume, and site were used to compare cerebellum volumes in PTSD compared to healthy controls (88% trauma-exposed). PTSD was associated with significant grey and white matter reductions of the cerebellum. Compared to controls, people with PTSD demonstrated smaller total cerebellum volume, as well as reduced volume in subregions primarily within the posterior lobe (lobule VIIB, crus II), vermis (VI, VIII), flocculonodular lobe (lobule X), and corpus medullare (all p<sub>-FDR</sub>â&lt;â0.05). Effects of PTSD on volume were consistent, and generally more robust, when examining symptom severity rather than diagnostic status. These findings implicate regionally specific cerebellar volumetric differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The cerebellum appears to play an important role in higher-order cognitive and emotional processes, far beyond its historical association with vestibulomotor function. Further examination of the cerebellum in trauma-related psychopathology will help to clarify how cerebellar structure and function may disrupt cognitive and affective processes at the center of translational models for PTSD.",both,[]

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained 3 models: (1) image-only; (2) risk factor (RF)-only multivariable logistic regression (LR) model adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes duration, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure; (3) hybrid multivariable LR model combining RF data and standardized z-scores from image-only model. Data from Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program (SiDRP) were used to develop (6066 participants with diabetes, primary-care-based) and internally validate (5-fold cross-validation) the models. External testing on 2 independent datasets: (1) Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study (1885 participants with diabetes, population-based); (2) Singapore Macroangiopathy and Microvascular Reactivity in Type 2 Diabetes (SMART2D) (439 participants with diabetes, cross-sectional) in Singapore. Supplementary external testing on 2 Caucasian cohorts: (3) Australian Eye and Heart Study (AHES) (460 participants with diabetes, cross-sectional) and (4) Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) (265 participants with diabetes, cross-sectional).
RESULTS: In SiDRP validation, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.826(95% CI 0.818-0.833) for image-only, 0.847(0.840-0.854) for RF-only, and 0.866(0.859-0.872) for hybrid. Estimates with SEED were 0.764(0.743-0.785) for image-only, 0.802(0.783-0.822) for RF-only, and 0.828(0.810-0.846) for hybrid. In SMART2D, AUC was 0.726(0.686-0.765) for image-only, 0.701(0.660-0.741) in RF-only, 0.761(0.724-0.797) for hybrid.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: There is potential for DLA using retinal images as a screening adjunct for DKD among individuals with diabetes. This can value-add to existing DLA systems which diagnose diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, facilitating primary screening for DKD.",both,['deep learning']

How computational assessments of TILs might complement manual TIL assessment in trial and daily practices is currently debated. Recent efforts to use machine learning (ML) to automatically evaluate TILs have shown promising results. We review state-of-the-art approaches and identify pitfalls and challenges of automated TIL evaluation by studying the root cause of ML discordances in comparison to manual TIL quantification. We categorize our findings into four main topics: (1) technical slide issues, (2) ML and image analysis aspects, (3) data challenges, and (4) validation issues. The main reason for discordant assessments is the inclusion of false-positive areas or cells identified by performance on certain tissue patterns or design choices in the computational implementation. To aid the adoption of ML for TIL assessment, we provide an in-depth discussion of ML and image analysis, including validation issues that need to be considered before reliable computational reporting of TILs can be incorporated into the trial and routine clinical management of patients with triple-negative breast cancer.

The aim of this research is to classify the alive and death status of breast cancer patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. Due to its capacity to handle enormous data sets systematically, machine learning and deep learning has been widely employed in biomedical research to answer diverse classification difficulties. Pre-processing the data enables its visualization and analysis for use in making important decisions. This research presents a feasible machine learning-based approach for categorizing SEER breast cancer dataset. Moreover, a two-step feature selection method based on Variance Threshold and Principal Component Analysis was employed to select the features from the SEER breast cancer dataset. After selecting the features, the classification of the breast cancer dataset is carried out using Supervised and Ensemble learning techniques such as Ada Boosting, XG Boosting, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. Utilizing the train-test split and k-fold cross-validation approaches, the performance of various machine learning algorithms is examined. The accuracy of Decision Tree for both train-test split and cross validation achieved as 98%. In this study, it is observed that the Decision Tree algorithm outperforms other supervised and ensemble learning approaches for the SEER Breast Cancer dataset.",both,"['deep learning', 'dl', 'visual', 'ensemble']"

Given major confounding factors such as age and comorbidities, true mediators of this condition have remained elusive. We used a multi-omics analysis combined with artificial intelligence in a young patient cohort where major comorbidities were excluded at the onset. The cohort included 47 âcriticalâ (in the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation) and 25 ânon-criticalâ (in a non-critical care ward) patients with COVID-19 and 22 healthy individuals. The analyses included whole-genome sequencing, whole-blood RNA sequencing, plasma and blood mononuclear cell proteomics, cytokine profiling, and high-throughput immunophenotyping. An ensemble of machine learning, deep learning, quantum annealing, and structural causal modeling were used. Patients with critical COVID-19 were characterized by exacerbated inflammation, perturbed lymphoid and myeloid compartments, increased coagulation, and viral cell biology. Among differentially expressed genes, we observed up-regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM9. This gene signature was validated in a second independent cohort of 81 critical and 73 recovered patients with COVID-19 and was further confirmed at the transcriptional and protein level and by proteolytic activity. Ex vivo ADAM9 inhibition decreased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uptake and replication in human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, within a young, otherwise healthy, cohort of individuals with COVID-19, we provide the landscape of biological perturbations in vivo where a unique gene signature differentiated critical from non-critical patients.

METHODS: Referable pterygium was defined as having extension towards the cornea from the limbus of >2.50âmm or base width at the limbus of >5.00âmm. 2503 images from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study were used as the development set. Algorithms were validated on an internal set from the SEED cohort (629 images (55.3% pterygium, 8.4% referable pterygium)), and tested on two external clinic-based sets (set 1 with 2610 images (2.8% pterygium, 0.7% referable pterygium, from slit-lamp ASP); and set 2 with 3701 images, 2.5% pterygium, 0.9% referable pterygium, from hand-held ASP).
RESULTS: The algorithm's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for detection of any pterygium was 99.5%(sensitivity=98.6%; specificity=99.0%) in internal test set, 99.1% (sensitivity=95.9%, specificity=98.5%) in external test set 1 and 99.7% (sensitivity=100.0%; specificity=88.3%) in external test set 2.

CONCLUSION: DL algorithms based on ASPs can detect presence of and referable-level pterygium with optimal sensitivity and specificity. These algorithms, particularly if used with a handheld camera, may potentially be used as a simple screening tool for detection of referable pterygium. Further validation in community setting is warranted.

However, little is known about whether these factors also influence breast tissue composition beyond what is captured by breast density among women with benign breast disease (BBD).
METHODS: This analysis included 788 controls from a nested case-control study of breast cancer within the Nurses' Health Study BBD subcohorts. Body fatness at ages 5 and 10 years was recalled using a 9-level pictogram. Weight at age 18, current weight, and height were reported via questionnaires. A deep-learning image analysis was used to quantify the percentages of epithelial, fibrous stromal, and adipose tissue areas within BBD slides. We performed linear mixed models to estimate beta coefficients (Î²) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the relationships between anthropometrics and the log-transformed percentages of individual tissue type, adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: Childhood body fatness (level â¥ 4.5 vs. 1), BMI at age 18 (â¥23 vs. &lt;19 kg/m2), and current adult BMI (â¥30 vs. &lt;21 kg/m2) were associated with higher proportions of adipose tissue [Î² (95% CI) = 0.34 (0.03, 0.65), 0.19 (-0.04-0.42), 0.40 (0.12, 0.68), respectively] and lower proportions of fibrous stromal tissue [-0.05 (-0.10, 0.002), -0.03 (-0.07, 0.003), -0.12 (-0.16, -0.07), respectively] during adulthood (all P <sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.04). BMI at age 18 was also inversely associated with epithelial tissue (P <sub>trend</sub> = 0.03). Adult height was not associated with any of the individual tissue types.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that body fatness has long-term impacts on breast tissue composition.

Deep learning neural network (DLNN) approach was considered in patients with brain stroke (BS) to predict and classify the outcome by the risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 332 patients with BS (mean age: 77.4 [standard deviation: 10.4] years, 50.6% - male) from Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ardabil, Iran, during 2008-2018 participated in this prospective study. Data were gathered from the available documents of the BS registry. Furthermore, the diagnosis of BS was considered based on computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. The DLNN strategy was applied to predict the effects of the main risk factors on mortality. The quality of the model was measured by diagnostic indices.
RESULTS: The finding of this study for 81 selected models demonstrated that ranges of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 90.5%-99.7%, 83.8%-100%, and 89.8%-99.5%, respectively. Based on the optimal model (tangent hyperbolic activation function with the minimum-maximum hidden units of 10-20, max epochs of 400, momentum of 0.5, and learning rate of 0.1), the most important predictors for BS mortality were time interval after 10 years (accuracy = 92.2%), age category (75.6%), the history of hyperlipoproteinemia (66.9%), and education level (66.9%). The other independent variables are at moderate importance (66.6%) which include sex, employment status, residential place, smoking habits, history of heart disease, cerebrovascular accident type, blood pressure, diabetes, oral contraceptive pill use, and physical activity.
CONCLUSION: The best means for dropping the BS load is effective BS prevention. DLNN strategy showed a surprising presentation in the prediction of BS mortality based on the main risk factors with an excellent diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the time interval after 10 years, age, the history of hyperlipoproteinemia, and education level are the most important predictors for BS.",both,"['deep learning', 'neural network']"

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine-learning model based on clinical features for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.
METHOD: 725 patients were used to train and validate the model. This included a retrospective cohort from Wuhan, China of 299 hospitalised COVID-19 patients from 23 December 2019 to 13 February 2020, and five cohorts with 426 patients from eight centres in China, Italy and Belgium from 20 February 2020 to 21 March 2020. The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalisation. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and metrics derived from the confusion matrix.
RESULTS: In the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50âyears and 137 (45.8%) were male. In the five test cohorts, the median age was 62âyears and 236 (55.4%) were male. The model was prospectively validated on five cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.84 to 0.93, with accuracies ranging from 74.4% to 87.5%, sensitivities ranging from 75.0% to 96.9%, and specificities ranging from 55.0% to 88.0%, most of which performed better than the pneumonia severity index. The cut-off values of the low-, medium- and high-risk probabilities were 0.21 and 0.80. The online calculators can be found at www.covid19risk.ai.
CONCLUSION: The machine-learning model, nomogram and online calculator might be useful to access the onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission.",both,[]

Studies comparing a market-approved CNN in a broad range of diagnoses to dermatologists working under less artificial conditions are lacking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred cases of pigmented/non-pigmented skin cancers and benign lesions were used for a two-level reader study in 96 dermatologists (level I: dermoscopy only; level II: clinical close-up images, dermoscopy, and textual information). Additionally, dermoscopic images were classified by a CNN approved for the European market as a medical device (Moleanalyzer Pro, FotoFinder Systems, Bad Birnbach, Germany). Primary endpoints were the sensitivity and specificity of the CNN's dichotomous classification in comparison with the dermatologists' management decisions. Secondary endpoints included the dermatologists' diagnostic decisions, their performance according to their level of experience, and the CNN's area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC).
RESULTS: The CNN revealed a sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 95.0% (95% CI 83.5% to 98.6%), 76.7% (95% CI 64.6% to 85.6%), and 0.918 (95% CI 0.866-0.970), respectively. In level I, the dermatologists' management decisions showed a mean sensitivity and specificity of 89.0% (95% CI 87.4% to 90.6%) and 80.7% (95% CI 78.8% to 82.6%). With level II information, the sensitivity significantly improved to 94.1% (95% CI 93.1% toÂ 95.1%; P < 0.001), while the specificity remained unchanged at 80.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 82.4%; PÂ = 0.97). When fixing the CNN's specificity at the mean specificity of the dermatologists' management decision in level II (80.4%), the CNN's sensitivity was almost equal to that of human raters, at 95% (95% CI 83.5% to 98.6%) versus 94.1% (95% CI 93.1% to 95.1%); PÂ = 0.1. In contrast, dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN in their level I management decisions and level I and II diagnostic decisions. More experienced dermatologists frequently surpassed the CNN's performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Under less artificial conditions and in a broader spectrum of diagnoses, the CNN and most dermatologists performed on the same level. Dermatologists are trained to integrate information from a range of sources rendering comparative studies that are solely based on one single case image inadequate.",both,"['dl', 'neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'convolutional neural network']"

Epub 2019 Dec 17.,Dembrower K,Radiology,2020,2019/12/18,,,10.1148/radiol.2019190872,"Background Most risk prediction models for breast cancer are based on questionnaires and mammographic density assessments. By training a deep neural network, further information in the mammographic images can be considered. Purpose To develop a risk score that is associated with future breast cancer and compare it with density-based models. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all women aged 40-74 years within the Karolinska University Hospital uptake area in whom breast cancer was diagnosed in 2013-2014 were included along with healthy control subjects. Network development was based on cases diagnosed from 2008 to 2012. The deep learning (DL) risk score, dense area, and percentage density were calculated for the earliest available digital mammographic examination for each woman. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the association with subsequent breast cancer. False-negative rates were obtained for the DL risk score, age-adjusted dense area, and age-adjusted percentage density. Results A total of 2283 women, 278 of whom were later diagnosed with breast cancer, were evaluated. The age at mammography (mean, 55.7 years vs 54.6 years; P &lt; .001), the dense area (mean, 38.2 cm2 vs 34.2 cm2; P &lt; .001), and the percentage density (mean, 25.6% vs 24.0%; P &lt; .001) were higher among women diagnosed with breast cancer than in those without a breast cancer diagnosis. The odds ratios and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were higher for age-adjusted DL risk score than for dense area and percentage density: 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48, 1.64; AUC, 0.65), 1.31 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.38; AUC, 0.60), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.25; AUC, 0.57), respectively (P &lt; .001 for AUC). The false-negative rate was lower: 31% (95% CI: 29%, 34%), 36% (95% CI: 33%, 39%; P = .006), and 39% (95% CI: 37%, 42%; P &lt; .001); this difference was most pronounced for more aggressive cancers. Conclusion Compared with density-based models, a deep neural network can more accurately predict which women are at risk for future breast cancer, with a lower false-negative rate for more aggressive cancers.

However, less is known about the use of such language to cast doubt on patient clinical history in hospital settings.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of language expressing doubt about patient clinical history (eg, experiences and symptoms) in hospital admission notes by patient race and ethnicity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, natural language processing tools were applied to analyze 54â¯936 admission notes from 1249 clinicians about patients aged 18 years or older at admission and hospitalized at an academic health system in the Northeast US between January 1, 2018, and February 28, 2023. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2022, to July 31, 2023.
EXPOSURE: Patient race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and racial and ethnic minoritized groups excluding non-Hispanic Black [includes multiple racial and ethnic groups, such as Hispanic and Asian]) as recorded in the EHR based on self-report or registrar determination.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Binary indicator for at least 1 term casting doubt on patient clinical history was defined using epistemic stance, a linguistic construct expressing a writer's degree of certainty in information. Terms were manually validated via iterative review of notes by the study team.
RESULTS: Among 56â¯325 admission notes (mean [SD] age of patients, 55.9 [19.0] years; 30â¯913 notes among female patients [54.9%]; 25â¯649 notes among non-Hispanic Black patients [45.5%], 26â¯442 notes among non-Hispanic White patients [46.9%], and 2985 notes among members of racial and ethnic minoritized groups excluding non-Hispanic Black patients [5.3%]), we analyzed 54â¯936 admission notes that had no missing data. Among all analyzed admission notes, 39â¯023 notes (71.0%) contained doubt language. Notes written about non-Hispanic Black patients had increased odds of containing at least 1 word or phrase of doubt (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; Pâ<â.001) compared with notes among non-Hispanic White patients. Compared with notes among non-Hispanic White patients, notes written about members of racial and ethnic minoritized groups excluding non-Hispanic Black patients had similar odds of containing at least 1 term of doubt.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, language casting doubt on patient clinical history was more likely to be found in notes of non-Hispanic Black patients. These results suggest that with the implementation of policies allowing patients full access to their health records, examining clinical documentation standards may be associated with improved patient experience.",both,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Epub 2024 Apr 23.,Graf EM,Am J Perinatol,2024,2024/04/23,,,10.1055/s-0044-1786033,"OBJECTIVE: âTo evaluate the reliability of three artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic) in generating accurate references from existing obstetric literature.
STUDY DESIGN: âBetween mid-March and late April 2023, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic were prompted to provide references for specific obstetrical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2020. RCTs were considered for inclusion if they were mentioned in a previous article that primarily evaluated RCTs published by the top medical and obstetrics and gynecology journals with the highest impact factors in 2020 as well as RCTs published in a new journal focused on publishing obstetric RCTs. The selection of the three AI models was based on their popularity, performance in natural language processing, and public availability. Data collection involved prompting the AI chatbots to provide references according to a standardized protocol. The primary evaluation metric was the accuracy of each AI model in correctly citing references, including authors, publication title, journal name, and digital object identifier (DOI). Statistical analysis was performed using a permutation test to compare the performance of the AI models.
RESULTS: âAmong the 44 RCTs analyzed, Google Bard demonstrated the highest accuracy, correctly citing 13.6% of the requested RCTs, whereas ChatGPT and Chatsonic exhibited lower accuracy rates of 2.4 and 0%, respectively. Google Bard often substantially outperformed Chatsonic and ChatGPT in correctly citing the studied reference components. The majority of references from all AI models studied were noted to provide DOIs for unrelated studies or DOIs that do not exist.
CONCLUSION: âTo ensure the reliability of scientific information being disseminated, authors must exercise caution when utilizing AI for scientific writing and literature search. However, despite their limitations, collaborative partnerships between AI systems and researchers have the potential to drive synergistic advancements, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.
KEY POINTS: Â· AI chatbots often cite scientific articles incorrectly.. Â· AI chatbots can create false references.. Â· Responsible AI use in research is vital..",both,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

Epub 2023 Nov 23.,Micale C,Drug Saf,2024,2023/11/23,,,10.1007/s40264-023-01366-5,"INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is the leading cause of heart disease in the world, and discontinuation or nonadherence of antihypertensive medication constitutes a significant global health concern. Patients with hypertension have high rates of medication nonadherence. Studies of reasons for nonadherence using traditional surveys are limited, can be expensive, and suffer from response, white-coat, and recall biases. Mining relevant posts by patients on social media is inexpensive and less impacted by the pressures and biases of formal surveys, which may provide direct insights into factors that lead to non-compliance with antihypertensive medication.
METHODS: This study examined medication ratings posted to WebMD, an online health forum that allows patients to post medication reviews. We used a previously developed natural language processing classifier to extract indications and reasons for changes in angiotensin receptor II blocker (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatments. After extraction, ratings were manually annotated and compared with data from the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) public database.
RESULTS: From a collection of 343,459 WebMD reviews, we automatically extracted 1867 posts mentioning changes in ACEIs or ARBs, and manually reviewed the 300 most recent posts regarding ACEI treatments and the 300 most recent posts regarding ARB treatments. After excluding posts that only mentioned a dose change or were a false-positive mention, 142 posts in the ARBs dataset and 187 posts in the ACEIs dataset remained. The majority of posts (97% ARBs, 91% ACEIs) indicated experiencing an adverse event as the reason for medication change. The most common adverse events reported mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities were ""musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders"" like muscle and joint pain for ARBs, and ""respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders"" like cough and shortness of breath for ACEIs. These categories also had the largest differences in percentage points, appearing more frequently on WebMD data than FDA data (pÂ <Â 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal and respiratory symptoms were the most commonly reported adverse effects in social media postings associated with drug discontinuation. Managing such symptoms is a potential target of interventions seeking to improve medication persistence.",both,"['language processing', 'natural language processing', 'language processing', 'natural language processing']"

METHODS: We analysed 91 drawings with associated descriptions submitted to the Swedish Archive of Children's Art from April 2020 to February 2021.
RESULTS: The visual and text analysis resulted in three themes. First, illustrating the virus and embodying the danger showed that young children understood the invisible enemy, combining realistic elements of the virus particle with fantasies of the 'virus monster' that needs to be fought off. Second, life has changed for the worse describes the profound effect the pandemic had on young children's lives also in Sweden, with comparatively mild restrictions and no school closures. Third, the virus spreads across the world, affects people and infects their bodies conveys young children's understanding of the pandemic as an existential challenge affecting the whole world. Children displayed surprisingly high levels of health literacy related to COVID-19, including contagion routes and the importance of hand hygiene.

Here, we describe a large-scale community effort to build an open access, interoperable and computable repository of COVID-19 molecular mechanisms. The COVID-19 Disease Map (C19DMap) is a graphical, interactive representation of disease-relevant molecular mechanisms linking many knowledge sources. Notably, it is a computational resource for graph-based analyses and disease modelling. To this end, we established a framework of tools, platforms and guidelines necessary for a multifaceted community of biocurators, domain experts, bioinformaticians and computational biologists. The diagrams of the C19DMap, curated from the literature, are integrated with relevant interaction and text mining databases. We demonstrate the application of network analysis and modelling approaches by concrete examples to highlight new testable hypotheses. This framework helps to find signatures of SARS-CoV-2 predisposition, treatment response or prioritisation of drug candidates.

However, it is unclear whether information derived from social media is generalizable to broader populations, especially middle-aged and older adults. Using data on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; nÂ =Â 49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (Ï) coefficients (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this large sample, effect sizes were mostly ""very small"" (conventionally defined as Ï or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: meanregular usersÂ =Â 19 vs. meannonregular usersÂ =Â 19 (dÂ =Â -0.03); physical activity: meanregular usersÂ =Â 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week vs. meannonregular usersÂ =Â 24 MET-hours/week (dÂ =Â 0.01)).

Results suggest that regular Facebook users were similar to nonregular users across sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with modestly worse health regarding obesity and depressive symptoms.

This study investigated associations between risk factors and late-life cognitive decline on a global scale, including comparisons between ethno-regional groups.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We harmonized longitudinal data from 20 population-based cohorts from 15 countries over 5 continents, including 48,522 individuals (58.4% women) aged 54-105 (mean = 72.7) years and without dementia at baseline. Studies had 2-15 years of follow-up. The risk factors investigated were age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, anxiety, apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele (APOE*4) status, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure and pulse pressure, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, self-rated health, high cholesterol, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, physical activity, smoking, and history of stroke. Associations with risk factors were determined for a global cognitive composite outcome (memory, language, processing speed, and executive functioning tests) and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Individual participant data meta-analyses of multivariable linear mixed model results pooled across cohorts revealed that for at least 1 cognitive outcome, age (B = -0.1, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.31, SE = 0.11), depression (B = -0.11, SE = 0.06), diabetes (B = -0.23, SE = 0.10), current smoking (B = -0.20, SE = 0.08), and history of stroke (B = -0.22, SE = 0.09) were independently associated with poorer cognitive performance (p < 0.05 for all), and higher levels of education (B = 0.12, SE = 0.02) and vigorous physical activity (B = 0.17, SE = 0.06) were associated with better performance (p < 0.01 for both). Age (B = -0.07, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.41, SE = 0.18), and diabetes (B = -0.18, SE = 0.10) were independently associated with faster cognitive decline (p < 0.05 for all). Different effects between Asian people and white people included stronger associations for Asian people between ever smoking and poorer cognition (group by risk factor interaction: B = -0.24, SE = 0.12), and between diabetes and cognitive decline (B = -0.66, SE = 0.27; p < 0.05 for both). Limitations of our study include a loss or distortion of risk factor data with harmonization, and not investigating factors at midlife.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that education, smoking, physical activity, diabetes, and stroke are all modifiable factors associated with cognitive decline. If these factors are determined to be causal, controlling them could minimize worldwide levels of cognitive decline. However, any global prevention strategy may need to consider ethno-regional differences.",both,['dl']

One-third of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease. This study will establish the relationship of SMI with cardiovascular disease in ethnic minority groups (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean, black African and Irish), in the UK.
METHODS: E-CHASM is a mixed methods study utilising data from 1.25 million electronic patient records. Secondary analysis of routine patient records will establish if differences in cause-specific mortality, cardiovascular disease prevalence and disparities in accessing healthcare for ethnic minority people living with SMI exist. A nested qualitative study will be used to assess barriers to accessing healthcare, both from the perspectives of service users and providers.
RESULTS: In primary care, 993,116 individuals, aged 18+, provided data from 186/189 (98 %) practices in four inner-city boroughs (local government areas) in London. Prevalence of SMI according to primary care records, ranged from 1.3-1.7 %, across boroughs. The primary care sample included Bangladeshi [n = 94,643 (10 %)], Indian [n = 6086 (6 %)], Pakistani [n = 35,596 (4 %)], black Caribbean [n = 45,013 (5 %)], black African [n = 75,454 (8 %)] and Irish people [n = 13,745 (1 %)]. In the secondary care database, 12,432 individuals with SMI over 2007-2013 contributed information; prevalent diagnoses were schizophrenia [n = 6805 (55 %)], schizoaffective disorders [n = 1438 (12 %)] and bipolar affective disorder [n = 4112 (33 %)]. Largest ethnic minority groups in this sample were black Caribbean [1432 (12 %)] and black African (1393 (11 %)).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of research examining cardiovascular disease in minority ethnic groups with severe mental illnesses. The E-CHASM study will address this knowledge gap.",both,['bert']

Online ahead of print.,Wang Y,Eur Heart J,2024,2024/09/01,,,10.1093/eurheartj/ehae593,"BACKGROUND: and aims: Cardiogenic shock (CS) remains the primary cause of in-hospital death after acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with its plateauing mortality rates approaching 50%. To test novel interventions, personalized risk prediction is essential. The ORBI (Observatoire RÃ©gional Breton sur l'Infarctus) score represents the first-of-its-kind risk score to predict in-hospital CS in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, its sex-specific performance remains unknown, and refined risk prediction strategies are warranted.
METHODS: This multinational study included a total of 53â537 ACS patients without CS on admission undergoing PCI. Following sex-specific evaluation of ORBI, regression and machine-learning models were used for variable selection and risk prediction. By combining best-performing models with highest-ranked predictors, SEX-SHOCK was developed, and internally and externally validated.
RESULTS: The ORBI score showed lower discriminative performance for the prediction of CS in females than males in Swiss (AUC [95% CI]: 0.78 [0.76-0.81] vs. 0.81 [0.79-0.83]; p=0.048) and French ACS patients (0.77 [0.74-0.81] vs. 0.84 [0.81-0.86]; p=0.002). The newly developed SEX-SHOCK score, now incorporating ST-segment elevation, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and left ventricular ejection fraction, outperformed ORBI in both sexes (females: 0.81 [0.78-0.83]; males: 0.83 [0.82-0.85]; p<0.001), which prevailed following internal and external validation in RICO (females: 0.82 [0.79-0.85]; males: 0.88 [0.86-0.89]; p<0.001) and SPUM-ACS (females: 0.83 [0.77-0.90], p=0.004; males: 0.83 [0.80-0.87], p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ORBI score showed modest sex-specific performance. The novel SEX-SHOCK score provides superior performance in females and males across the entire spectrum of ACS, thus providing a basis for future interventional trials and contemporary ACS management.",both,[]

Predicting these outcomes at diagnosis, when important clinical decisions need to be made, has proven to be a difficult task.
METHODS: 52 clinical features from existing models or the literature were collected retrospectively within Â±48Â h of diagnosis among 1660 inpatient infections. A modified desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) was designed to encompass clinically-important severe events attributable to the acute infection (intensive care transfer due to sepsis, shock, colectomy/ileostomy, mortality) and/or 60-day recurrence. A deep neural network was constructed and interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). High-importance features were used to train a reduced, shallow network and performance was compared to existing conventional models (7 severity, 7 recurrence; after summing DOOR probabilities to align with conventional binary outputs) using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and DeLong tests.
FINDINGS: The full (52-feature) model achieved an out-of-sample AUROC 0.823 for severity and 0.678 for recurrence. SHAP identified 13 unique, highly-important features (age, hypotension, initial treatment, onset, PCR cycle threshold, number of prior episodes, antibiotic exposure, fever, hypotension, pressors, leukocytosis, creatinine, lactate) that were used to train a reduced model, which performed similarly to the full model (severity AUROC difference PÂ =Â 0.130; recurrence PÂ =Â 0.426) and significantly better than the top severity model (reduced model predicting severity 0.837, ATLAS 0.749; PÂ =Â 0.001). The reduced model also outperformed the top recurrence model, but this was not statistically-significant (reduced model recurrence AUROC 0.653, IDSA Recurrence Risk Criteria 0.595; PÂ =Â 0.196). The final, reduced model was deployed as a web application with real-time SHAP explanations.
INTERPRETATION: Our final model outperformed existing severity and recurrence models; however, it requires external validation. A DOOR output allows specific clinical questions to be asked with explainable predictions that can be feasibly implemented with limited computing resources.

METHODS: A prospective database gathered among 78 Italian surgical centers in two prospective studies, including 6241 patients who underwent elective colorectal resection with anastomosis for malignant or benign disease, was re-analyzed through a multi-treatment machine-learning model considering no bowel preparation (NBP; No.â=â3742; 60.0%) as the reference treatment arm, compared to oral antibiotics alone (oA; No.â=â406; 6.5%), mechanical bowel preparation alone (MBP; No.â=â1486; 23.8%), or in combination with oAB (MoABP; No.â=â607; 9.7%). Twenty covariates related to biometric data, surgical procedures, perioperative management, and hospital/center data potentially affecting outcomes were included and balanced into the model. The primary endpoints were AL, SSIs, and OM. All the results were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: Compared to NBP, MBP showed significantly higher AL risk (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.23-2.71; pâ=â.003) and OM risk (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.10-1.72; pâ=â.005), no significant differences for all the endpoints were recorded in the oA group, whereas MoABP showed a significantly reduced SSI risk (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.25-0.79; pâ=â.008).
CONCLUSIONS: MoABP significantly reduced the SSI risk after elective colorectal surgery, therefore representing a valid alternative to NBP.",both,[]

This study aimed to predict survival outcomes of CRC patients using machine learning (ML) methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 1853 CRC patients admitted to three prominent tertiary hospitals in Iran from October 2006 to July 2019. Six ML methods, namely logistic regression (LR), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree (DT), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), were developed with 10-fold cross-validation. Feature selection employed the Random Forest method based on mean decrease GINI criteria. Model performance was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Time from diagnosis, age, tumor size, metastatic status, lymph node involvement, and treatment type emerged as crucial predictors of survival based on mean decrease GINI. The NB (AUC = 0.70, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.65-0.75) and LGBM (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI 0.65-0.75) models achieved the highest predictive AUC values for CRC patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significance of variables including time from diagnosis, age, tumor size, metastatic status, lymph node involvement, and treatment type in predicting CRC survival. The NB model exhibited optimal efficacy in mortality prediction, maintaining a balanced sensitivity and specificity. Policy recommendations encompass early diagnosis and treatment initiation for CRC patients, improved data collection through digital health records and standardized protocols, support for predictive analytics integration in clinical decisions, and the inclusion of identified prognostic variables in treatment guidelines to enhance patient outcomes.",both,[]

We hypothesised that a novel artificial intelligence approach could better assess multiple and higher-dimension interactions of comorbidities, and define clusters of Î²-blocker efficacy in patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: Neural network-based variational autoencoders and hierarchical clustering were applied to pooled individual patient data from nine double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of Î² blockers. All-cause mortality during median 1Â·3 years of follow-up was assessed by intention to treat, stratified by electrocardiographic heart rhythm. The number of clusters and dimensions was determined objectively, with results validated using a leave-one-trial-out approach. This study was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00832442) and the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42014010012).
FINDINGS: 15â659 patients with heart failure and LVEF of less than 50% were included, with median age 65 years (IQR 56-72) and LVEF 27% (IQR 21-33). 3708 (24%) patients were women. In sinus rhythm (n=12â822), most clusters demonstrated a consistent overall mortality benefit from Î² blockers, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0Â·54 to 0Â·74. One cluster in sinus rhythm of older patients with less severe symptoms showed no significant efficacy (OR 0Â·86, 95% CI 0Â·67-1Â·10; p=0Â·22). In atrial fibrillation (n=2837), four of five clusters were consistent with the overall neutral effect of Î² blockers versus placebo (OR 0Â·92, 0Â·77-1Â·10; p=0Â·37). One cluster of younger atrial fibrillation patients at lower mortality risk but similar LVEF to average had a statistically significant reduction in mortality with Î² blockers (OR 0Â·57, 0Â·35-0Â·93; p=0Â·023). The robustness and consistency of clustering was confirmed for all models (p<0Â·0001 vs random), and cluster membership was externally validated across the nine independent trials.
INTERPRETATION: An artificial intelligence-based clustering approach was able to distinguish prognostic response from Î² blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF. This included patients in sinus rhythm with suboptimal efficacy, as well as a cluster of patients with atrial fibrillation where Î² blockers did reduce mortality.

METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and acute respiratory failure admitted from 63 ICUs in Spain. The objective was to utilize an unsupervised clustering analysis to derive clinical COVID-19 phenotypes and to analyze patient's factors associated with mortality risk. Patient features including demographics and clinical data at ICU admission were analyzed. Generalized linear models were used to determine ICU morality risk factors. The prognostic models were validated and their performance was measured using accuracy test, sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves.
RESULTS: The database included a total of 2022 patients (mean age 64 [IQR 5-71] years, 1423 (70.4%) male, median APACHE II score (13 [IQR 10-17]) and SOFA score (5 [IQR 3-7]) points. The ICU mortality rate was 32.6%. Of the 3 derived phenotypes, the A (mild) phenotype (537; 26.7%) included older age (<â65Â years), fewer abnormal laboratory values and less development of complications, B (moderate) phenotype (623, 30.8%) had similar characteristics of A phenotype but were more likely to present shock. The C (severe) phenotype was the most common (857; 42.5%) and was characterized by the interplay of older age (>â65Â years), high severity of illness and a higher likelihood of development shock. Crude ICU mortality was 20.3%, 25% and 45.4% for A, B and C phenotype respectively. The ICU mortality risk factors and model performance differed between whole population and phenotype classifications.
CONCLUSION: The presented machine learning model identified three clinical phenotypes that significantly correlated with host-response patterns and ICU mortality. Different risk factors across the whole population and clinical phenotypes were observed which may limit the application of a ""one-size-fits-all"" model in practice.",both,[]

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Second Hospital of Lanzhou University.
PATIENTS: This study involved 912 patients with primary cranial nerve disease who had undergone microvascular decompression surgery between July 2007 and June 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS: We collected data on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables. Statistical analysis was conducted in R, and the model was constructed with python. The machine learning model was run using the following models: decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, gbm, and GBDT models.

METHODS: The retrospective observational study assessed 55 surgical PDAC patients. Molecular subtypes were defined by immunohistochemical staining of KRT81. Tumors were manually segmented and 1606 radiomic features were extracted with PyRadiomics. A gradient-boosted-tree algorithm was trained on 70% of the patients (N = 28) and tested on 30% (N = 17) to predict KRT81+ vs. KRT81- tumor subtypes. A gradient-boosted survival regression model was fit to the disease-free and overall survival data. Chemotherapy response and survival were assessed stratified by subtype and radiomic signature. Radiomic feature importance was ranked.
RESULTS: The meanÂ±STDEV sensitivity, specificity and ROC-AUC were 0.90Â±0.07, 0.92Â±0.11, and 0.93Â±0.07, respectively. The meanÂ±STDEV concordance indices between the disease-free and overall survival predicted by the model based on the radiomic parameters and actual patient survival were 0.76Â±0.05 and 0.71Â±0.06, respectively. Patients with a KRT81+ subtype experienced significantly diminished median overall survival compared to KRT81- patients (7.0 vs. 22.6 months, HR 4.03, log-rank-test P = <0.001) and a significantly improved response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy over FOLFIRINOX (10.14 vs. 3.8 months median overall survival, HR 2.33, P = 0.037) compared to KRT81- patients, who responded significantly better to FOLFIRINOX over gemcitabine-based treatment (30.8 vs. 13.4 months median overall survival, HR 2.41, P = 0.027). Entropy was ranked as the most important radiomic feature.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine-learning based analysis of radiomic features enables the prediction of subtypes of PDAC, which are highly relevant for disease-free and overall patient survival and response to chemotherapy.",both,['diffusion']

Using in-hospital data available within the first 24 hours of admission, we aimed to develop more accurate models of risk prediction using both logistic regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) techniques, with a combination of demographic, physiologic, and biochemical information.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patient-level data were extracted from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database for patients who had experienced a cardiac arrest within 24 hours prior to admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the period January 2006 to December 2016. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The models were trained and tested on a dataset (split 90:10) including age, lowest and highest physiologic variables during the first 24 hours, and key past medical history. LR and 5 ML approaches (gradient boosting machine [GBM], support vector classifier [SVC], random forest [RF], artificial neural network [ANN], and an ensemble) were compared to the APACHE III and Australian and New Zealand Risk of Death (ANZROD) predictions. In all, 39,566 patients from 186 ICUs were analysed. Mean (Â±SD) age was 61 Â± 17 years; 65% were male. Overall in-hospital mortality was 45.5%. Models were evaluated in the test set. The APACHE III and ANZROD scores demonstrated good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.80 [95% CI 0.79-0.82] and 0.81 [95% CI 0.8-0.82], respectively) and modest calibration (Brier score 0.19 for both), which was slightly improved by LR (AUROC = 0.82 [95% CI 0.81-0.83], DeLong test, p < 0.001). Discrimination was significantly improved using ML models (ensemble and GBM AUROCs = 0.87 [95% CI 0.86-0.88], DeLong test, p < 0.001), with an improvement in performance (Brier score reduction of 22%). Explainability models were created to assist in identifying the physiologic features that most contributed to an individual patient's survival. Key limitations include the absence of pre-hospital data and absence of external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: ML approaches significantly enhance predictive discrimination for mortality following cardiac arrest compared to existing illness severity scores and LR, without the use of pre-hospital data. The discriminative ability of these ML models requires validation in external cohorts to establish generalisability.",both,"['neural network', 'artificial neural network', 'ensemble']"

PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 in transforming cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports into text that is comprehensible to medical laypersons.
METHODS: ChatGPT with GPT-4 architecture was used to generate three different explained versions of 20 various CMR reports (n = 60) using the same prompt: ""Explain the radiology report in a language understandable to a medical layperson"". Two cardiovascular radiologists evaluated understandability, factual correctness, completeness of relevant findings, and lack of potential harm, while 13 medical laypersons evaluated the understandability of the original and the GPT-4 reports on a Likert scale (1 ""strongly disagree"", 5 ""strongly agree""). Readability was measured using the Automated Readability Index (ARI). Linear mixed-effects models (values given as median [interquartile range]) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: GPT-4 reports were generated on average in 52Â sÂ Â±Â 13. GPT-4 reports achieved a lower ARI score (10 [9-12] vs 5 [4-6]; pÂ <Â 0.001) and were subjectively easier to understand for laypersons than original reports (1 [1] vs 4 [4,5]; pÂ <Â 0.001). Eighteen out of 20 (90%) standard CMR reports and 2/60 (3%) GPT-generated reports had an ARI score corresponding to the 8th grade level or higher. Radiologists' ratings of the GPT-4 reports reached high levels for correctness (5 [4, 5]), completeness (5 [5]), and lack of potential harm (5 [5]); with ""strong agreement"" for factual correctness in 94% (113/120) and completeness of relevant findings in 81% (97/120) of reports. Test-retest agreement for layperson understandability ratings between the three simplified reports generated from the same original report was substantial (ICC: 0.62; pÂ <Â 0.001). Interrater agreement between radiologists was almost perfect for lack of potential harm (ICC: 0.93, pÂ <Â 0.001) and moderate to substantial for completeness (ICC: 0.76, pÂ <Â 0.001) and factual correctness (ICC: 0.55, pÂ <Â 0.001).
CONCLUSION: GPT-4 can reliably transform complex CMR reports into more understandable, layperson-friendly language while largely maintaining factual correctness and completeness, and can thus help convey patient-relevant radiology information in an easy-to-understand manner.",both,['dl']

Whether a general-purpose AI language model can perform diagnosis and triage is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Compare the general-purpose Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) AI model's diagnostic and triage performance to attending physicians and lay adults who use the Internet.
DESIGN: We compared the accuracy of GPT-3's diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated case vignettes of both common (e.g., viral illness) and severe (e.g., heart attack) conditions to lay people and practicing physicians. Finally, we examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was for diagnosis and triage.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The GPT-3 model, a nationally representative sample of lay people, and practicing physicians.
EXPOSURE: Validated case vignettes (&lt;60 words; &lt;6th grade reading level).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correct diagnosis, correct triage.
RESULTS: Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top 3 for 88% (95% CI, 75% to 94%) of cases, compared to 54% (95% CI, 53% to 55%) for lay individuals (p<0.001) and 96% (95% CI, 94% to 97%) for physicians (p=0.0354). GPT-3 triaged (71% correct; 95% CI, 57% to 82%) similarly to lay individuals (74%; 95% CI, 73% to 75%; p=0.73); both were significantly worse than physicians (91%; 95% CI, 89% to 93%; p<0.001). As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well-calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score = 0.18) and triage (Brier score = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below physicians and better than lay individuals. The model was performed less well on triage, where its performance was closer to that of lay individuals.",both,[]
