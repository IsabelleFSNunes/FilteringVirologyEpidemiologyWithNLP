We also aimed to assess relationships with neurocognition and determine clinical-, treatment-, and health-related factors moderating intrinsic brain activity in aging HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals. The current report presents data on 54 HIV+ individuals (age Mâ¯=â¯41, SDâ¯=â¯12â¯years) stabilized on cART and 54 socio-demographically matched healthy (HIV-) comparators (age Mâ¯=â¯43, SDâ¯=â¯12â¯years), with cohort education mean of 16â¯years (SDâ¯=â¯12). Age at seroconversion ranged 20-55â¯years old. ANOVA assessed additive and synergistic effects of age and HIV in 133 ROIs. Bivariate statistics examined relationships of FC indices vulnerable to age-HIV interactions and neurocognitive domains T-scores (attention, executive, memory, psychomotor, semantic skills). Multivariate logistic models determined covariates of FC. This study found no statistically significant age-HIV effects on RS-FC after correcting for multiple comparisons except for synergistic effects on connectivity within cingulo-opercular network (CON) at the trending level. However, for uncorrected RS connectivity analyses, we observed HIV-related strengthening between regions of fronto-parietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN), and particular DMN regions and sensorimotor network (SMN). Simultaneously, FC weakening was observed within FPN and between other regions of DMN-SMN, in HIV+ vs. HIV- individuals. Ten ROI pairs revealed age-HIV interactions, with FC decreasing with age in HIV+, while increasing in controls. FC correlated with particular cognitive domains positively in HIV+ vs. negatively in HIV- group. Proportion of life prior-to-after HIV-seroconversion, post-infection years, and treatment determined within-FPN and SMN-DMN FC. In sum, highly functioning HIV+/cART+ patients do not reveal significantly altered RS-FC from healthy comparators. Nonetheless, the current findings uncorrected for multiple comparisons suggest that HIV infection may lead to simultaneous increases and decreases in FC in distinct brain regions even in patients successfully stabilized on cART. Moreover, RS-fMRI ROI-based analysis can be sensitive to age-HIV interactions, which are especially pronounced for inter-network FC in relation to neurocognition. Aging and treatment-related factors partially explain RS-FC in aging HIV+ patients.",text mining,['bert']

The illness represents a syndrome of visual deficits, not only a deterioration of visual acuity. This syndrome includes: presence of crowding phenomena, contrast sensitivity deterioration, deficits in accommodation, deterioration of spatial orientation and ocular motility dysfunction. Depending on its etiology, amblyopia is classified into four main types: strabismic amblyopia, anisometropic amblyopia, isoametropic amblyopia and stimulus deprivation amblyopia. To successfully treat the ""lazy eye"" it is essential to remove the amblyopic factor with techniques addressing each disturbing factor. Techniques used for treating amblyopia include: occlusion, optical penalty or pharmacological, therapy with Levodopa and computer vision therapy. Amblyopia treatment is lengthy and it is very important to counsel not only the child but the whole family and to establish a relationship of trust between doctor and patient in order to get high treatment compliance and high child motivation.",text mining,"['computer vision', 'vision', 'visual']"

Six types of Takayasu arteritis are recognized; the type depends on whether the ascending aorta, descending thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, aortic cervicobrachial branches, or renal arteries are affected. The coronary and pulmonary arteries are also sometimes involved. Clinical features of the disease include diminished or absent pulses, claudication, hypertension, and mesenteric angina. Conventional angiography has been the standard imaging tool for diagnosis and evaluation of Takayasu arteritis, although it demonstrates only the lumen of the vessel. Less invasive cross-sectional methods such as computed tomographic angiography and, more recently, three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) angiography can effectively demonstrate thickening of the vessel wall, which may be the earliest manifestation of the disease, occurring before stenosis and dilatation. MR imaging in particular allows better soft-tissue differentiation and can show other signs of inflammation, including mural edema and increased mural vascularity. Other advantages of MR imaging are the lack of iodinated contrast material or ionizing radiation.",text mining,[]

The standard deviation of the roundness factor has been shown to be another parameter with statistically significant differences between the two groups. Forward stepwise discriminant analysis was adopted in order to identify the quantitative features which contributed most significantly to discriminating between the two groups. The results suggested a combination of two features, i.e. the standard deviation of the logarithm of the roundness factor and the mean of the logarithm of the roundness factor. The comparison between actual and predicted categories showed 68.18% agreement: 7 out of 22 cases were allocated incorrectly by the computer.

Online ahead of print.,Zhang X,Med Phys,2024,2024/07/23,,,10.1002/mp.17319,"BACKGROUND: Forty to fifty percent of women and 13%-22% of men experience an osteoporosis-related fragility fracture in their lifetimes. After the age of 50 years, the risk of hip fracture doubles in every 10 years. x-Ray based DXA is currently clinically used to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk. However, it provides only 2-D representation of bone and is associated with other technical limitations. Thus, alternative methods are needed.
PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate an ultra-low dose (ULD) hip CT-based automated method for assessment of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at proximal femoral subregions.
METHODS: An automated method was developed to segment the proximal femur in ULD hip CT images and delineate femoral subregions. The computational pipeline consists of deep learning (DL)-based computation of femur likelihood map followed by shape model-based femur segmentation and finite element analysis-based warping of a reference subregion labeling onto individual femur shapes. Finally, vBMD is computed over each subregion in the target image using a calibration phantom scan. A total of 100 participants (50 females) were recruited from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study, and ULD hip CT imaging, equivalent to 18 days of background radiation received by U.S. residents, was performed on each participant. Additional hip CT imaging using a clinical protocol was performed on 12 participants and repeat ULD hip CT was acquired on another five participants. ULD CT images from 80 participants were used to train the DL network; ULD CT images of the remaining 20 participants as well as clinical and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate the accuracy, generalizability, and reproducibility of segmentation of femoral subregions. Finally, clinical CT and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate accuracy and reproducibility of ULD CT-based automated measurements of femoral vBMD.
RESULTS: Dice scores of accuracy (nÂ =Â 20), reproducibility (nÂ =Â 5), and generalizability (nÂ =Â 12) of ULD CT-based automated subregion segmentation were 0.990, 0.982, and 0.977, respectively, for the femoral head and 0.941, 0.970, and 0.960, respectively, for the femoral neck. ULD CT-based regional vBMD showed Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients of 0.994 and 0.977, respectively, and a root-mean-square coefficient of variation (RMSCV) (%) of 1.39% with the clinical CT-derived reference measure. After 3-digit approximation, each of Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between baseline and repeat scans were 0.996 with RMSCV of 0.72%. Results of ULD CT-based bone analysis on 100 participants (age (meanÂ Â±Â SD) 73.6Â Â±Â 6.6 years) show that males have significantly greater (pÂ <Â 0.01) vBMD at the femoral head and trochanteric regions than females, while females have moderately greater vBMD (pÂ =Â 0.05) at the medial half of the femoral neck than males.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning, combined with shape model and finite element analysis, offers an accurate, reproducible, and generalizable algorithm for automated segmentation of the proximal femur and anatomic femoral subregions using ULD hip CT images. ULD CT-based regional measures of femoral vBMD are accurate and reproducible and demonstrate regional differences between males and females.",text mining,['deep learning']

A crucial aspect of controlling the disease's spread is the epidemiological survey of patients and the subsequent analysis of epidemiological survey reports (case reports). However, current mainstream analysis approaches are all made manually. This manual method is time-consuming and manpower-intensive. This paper designs an automated visual epidemiological survey analysis (AVESA) framework for the epidemiological survey on COVID-19. AVESA designs a deep neural network for information extraction from case reports and automatically constructs an epidemiological knowledge graph based on predefined pattern. Moreover, a multi-dimensional knowledge reasoning model is developed for conducting knowledge reasoning in the complete COVID-19 epidemiological knowledge graph. In the entity extraction sub-task and multi-task extraction sub-task, AVESA achieved F1 scores of 85.12% and 92.29% respectively on the constructed dataset, significantly outperforming the standalone information extraction models. In full-graph computing, all three experiments align closely with manual analysis standards. In the risk analysis experiment, the weighted PageRank algorithm showed an average improvement of 11.21% in Top_Recall_n% over the standard PageRank algorithm. In the community detection experiment, the weighted Louvain algorithm showed a mere 4.34% community difference rate compared to manual analysis.",text mining,"['visual', 'neural network']"

Its diagnosis is confirmed through histopathology. It is of critical importance to determine the need for biopsy and identify the correct location. Deep learning has demonstrated great promise/success in several image-based medical screening/diagnostic applications. However, automated visual evaluation of oral cavity lesions has received limited attention in the literature. Since the disease can occur in different parts of the oral cavity, a first step is to identify the images of different anatomical sites. We automatically generate labels for six sites which will help in lesion detection in a subsequent analytical module. We apply a recently proposed network called ResNeSt that incorporates channel-wise attention with multi-path representation and demonstrate high performance on the test set. The average F1-score for all classes and accuracy are both 0.96. Moreover, we provide a detailed discussion on class activation maps obtained from both correct and incorrect predictions to analyze algorithm behavior. The highlighted regions in the class activation maps generally correlate considerably well with the region of interest perceived and expected by expert human observers. The insights and knowledge gained from the analysis are helpful in not only algorithm improvement, but also aiding the development of the other key components in the process of computer assisted oral cancer screening.",text mining,['visual']

The AREDS 9-step detailed scale's complexity and implementation solely with highly trained fundus photograph graders potentially hampered its clinical use, warranting development and use of an alternate AREDS simple scale, which although valuable, has less predictive ability.
OBJECTIVE: To describe DL techniques for the AREDS 9-step detailed severity scale for AMD to estimate 5-year risk probability with reasonable accuracy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used data collected from November 13, 1992, to November 30, 2005, from 4613 study participants of the AREDS data set to develop deep convolutional neural networks that were trained to provide detailed automated AMD grading on several AMD severity classification scales, using a multiclass classification setting. Two AMD severity classification problems using criteria based on 4-step (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3, and AMD-4 from classifications developed for AREDS eligibility criteria) and 9-step (from AREDS detailed severity scale) AMD severity scales were investigated. The performance of these algorithms was compared with a contemporary human grader and against a criterion standard (fundus photograph reading center graders) used at the time of AREDS enrollment and follow-up. Three methods for estimating 5-year risk were developed, including one based on DL regression. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, through April 15, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Weighted Îº scores and mean unsigned errors for estimating 5-year risk probability of progression to advanced AMD.
RESULTS: This study used 67â¯401 color fundus images from the 4613 study participants. The weighted Îº scores were 0.77 for the 4-step and 0.74 for the 9-step AMD severity scales. The overall mean estimation error for the 5-year risk ranged from 3.5% to 5.3%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that DL AMD grading has, for the 4-step classification evaluation, performance comparable with that of humans and achieves promising results for providing AMD detailed severity grading (9-step classification), which normally requires highly trained graders, and for estimating 5-year risk of progression to advanced AMD. Use of DL has the potential to assist physicians in longitudinal care for individualized, detailed risk assessment as well as clinical studies of disease progression during treatment or as public screening or monitoring worldwide.",text mining,"['deep learning', 'neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'llm', 'convolutional neural network']"

MedTaggerIE, an open-source NLP pipeline for information extraction based on text patterns, has been widely used in the annotation of clinical notes. A rule-based system, MedTagger-total hip arthroplasty (THA), developed based on MedTaggerIE, was previously shown to correctly identify the surgical approach, fixation, and bearing surface from the THA operative notes at Mayo Clinic.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the implementability, usability, and portability of MedTagger-THA at two external institutions, Michigan Medicine and the University of Iowa, and provide lessons learned for best practices.
METHODS: We conducted iterative test-apply-refinement processes with three involved sites-the development site (Mayo Clinic) and two deployment sites (Michigan Medicine and the University of Iowa). Mayo Clinic was the primary NLP development site, with the THA registry as the gold standard. The activities at the two deployment sites included the extraction of the operative notes, gold standard development (Michigan: registry data; Iowa: manual chart review), the refinement of NLP algorithms on training data, and the evaluation of test data. Error analyses were conducted to understand language variations across sites. To further assess the model specificity for approach and fixation, we applied the refined MedTagger-THA to arthroscopic hip procedures and periacetabular osteotomy cases, as neither of these operative notes should contain any approach or fixation keywords.
RESULTS: MedTagger-THA algorithms were implemented and refined independently for both sites. At Michigan, the study comprised THA-related notes for 2569 patient-date pairs. Before model refinement, MedTagger-THA algorithms demonstrated excellent accuracy for approach (96.6%, 95% CI 94.6%-97.9%) and fixation (95.7%, 95% CI 92.4%-97.6%). These results were comparable with internal accuracy at the development site (99.2% for approach and 90.7% for fixation). Model refinement improved accuracies slightly for both approach (99%, 95% CI 97.6%-99.6%) and fixation (98%, 95% CI 95.3%-99.3%). The specificity of approach identification was 88.9% for arthroscopy cases, and the specificity of fixation identification was 100% for both periacetabular osteotomy and arthroscopy cases. At the Iowa site, the study comprised an overall data set of 100 operative notes (50 training notes and 50 test notes). MedTagger-THA algorithms achieved moderate-high performance on the training data. After model refinement, the model achieved high performance for approach (100%, 95% CI 91.3%-100%), fixation (98%, 95% CI 88.3%-100%), and bearing surface (92%, 95% CI 80.5%-97.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: High performance across centers was achieved for the MedTagger-THA algorithms, demonstrating that they were sufficiently implementable, usable, and portable to different deployment sites. This study provided important lessons learned during the model deployment and validation processes, and it can serve as a reference for transferring rule-based electronic health record models.",text mining,"['language processing', 'language processing']"

Part of the Australian response was a robust primary care approach, involving changes to care models (including telehealth) and the widespread use of data to inform the changes. This paper outlines how a large primary care database responded to provide real-time data to inform policy and practice. Simply extracting the data is not sufficient. Understanding the data is. The POpulation Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) program is designed to use GP data for multiple objectives and is built on a pre-existing engagement framework established over a fifteen-year period. Initially developed to provide QA activities for general practices and population level data for General Practice support organisations, the POLAR platform has demonstrated the critical ability to design and deploy real-time data analytics solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic for a variety of stakeholders including state and federal government agencies.
METHODS: The system extracts and processes data from over 1,300 general practices daily. Data is de-identified at the point of collection and encrypted before transfer. Data cleaning for analysis uses a variety of techniques, including Natural Language Processing and coding of free text information. The curated dataset is then distilled into several analytic solutions designed to address specific areas of investigation of interest to various stakeholders. One such analytic solution was a model we created that used multiple data inputs to rank patient geographic areas by the likelihood of a COVID-19 outbreak. The model utilised pathology ordering, COVID-19 related diagnoses, indication of COVID-19 related concern (via progress notes) and also incorporated state based actual confirmed case figures.
RESULTS: Using the methods described, we were able to deliver real-time data feeds to practices, Primary Health Networks (PHN) and other agencies. In addition, we developed a COVID-19 geographic risk stratification based on local government areas (LGAs) to pro-actively inform the primary care response. Providing PHNs with a list of geographic priority hotspots allowed for better targeting and response of Personal Protective Equipment allocation and pop-up clinic placement.
CONCLUSIONS: The program summarised here demonstrates the ability of a well-designed system underpinned by accurate and reliable data, to respond in real-time to a rapidly evolving public health emergency in a way which supports and enhances the health system response.",text mining,['dl']

METHODEN: Aus einer radiologischen Klinik wurden aus 7102 CT-Befunden 1000 zufÃ¤llig ausgewÃ¤hlt. Diese wurden von 2 Medizinern manuell in definierte Befundgruppen eingeteilt. Zur automatisierten Verschlagwortung und Klassifizierung wurde die Textanalyse-Software Averbis Extraction Platform (AEP) eingesetzt. Besonderheiten des Systems sind u.âa. eine morphologische Analyse zur Zerlegung zusammengesetzter WÃ¶rter sowie die Erkennung von Nominalphrasen, AbkÃ¼rzungen und negierten Aussagen.

ERGEBNISSE: Die manuelle Klassifizierung war zu zeitaufwendig. Bei der automatisierten Verschlagwortung stellte sich in unseren Daten die Klassifizierung nach ICD-10 als ungeeignet heraus. Ebenfalls zeigte sich, dass die Stichwortsuche keine verlÃ¤sslichen Ergebnisse liefert. ComputerunterstÃ¼tztes Textmining in Kombination mit maschinellem Lernen fÃ¼hrte zu verlÃ¤sslichen Klassifizierungen. Die Inter-Rater-ReliabilitÃ¤t der beiden manuellen Klassifizierungen, sowie der maschinellen und der manuellen Klassifizierung war sehr hoch. Beide manuelle Klassifizierungen stimmten in 93% aller Befunde Ã¼berein. Der Kappa-Koeffizient betrÃ¤gt 0,89 [95% Konfidenzintervall (KI) 0,87-0,92].

Accurate prediction of sepsis outcomes is crucial for effective treatment and management. Previous studies have utilized machine learning for prognosis, but have limitations in feature sets and model interpretability.
AIM: This study aims to develop a machine learning model that enhances prediction accuracy for sepsis outcomes using a reduced set of features, thereby addressing the limitations of previous studies and enhancing model interpretability.
METHODS: This study analyzes intensive care patient outcomes using the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adult sepsis cases. Employing the latest data extraction tools, such as Google BigQuery, and following stringent selection criteria, we selected 38 features in this study. This selection is also informed by a comprehensive literature review and clinical expertise. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, regrouping categorical variables, and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data. We evaluated several machine learning models: Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. The Sequential Halving and Classification (SHAC) algorithm was used for hyperparameter tuning, and both train-test split and cross-validation methodologies were employed for performance and computational efficiency.
RESULTS: The Random Forest model was the most effective, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 with a confidence interval of Â±0.01. This significantly outperformed other models and set a new benchmark in the literature. The model also provided detailed insights into the importance of various clinical features, with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and average urine output being highly predictive. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis further enhanced the model's interpretability, offering a clearer understanding of feature impacts.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates significant improvements in predicting sepsis outcomes using a Random Forest model, supported by advanced machine learning techniques and thorough data preprocessing. Our approach provided detailed insights into the key clinical features impacting sepsis mortality, making the model both highly accurate and interpretable. By enhancing the model's practical utility in clinical settings, we offer a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions, ultimately aiming to minimize sepsis-induced fatalities.",text mining,['dl']

OBJECTIVE: To compare different machine learning methods in predicting overall mortality in cirrhosis and to use machine learning to select easily scored clinical variables for a novel cirrhosis prognostic model.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used a retrospective cohort of adult patients with cirrhosis or its complications seen in 130 hospitals and affiliated ambulatory clinics in the integrated, national Veterans Affairs health care system from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015. Patients were followed up through December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Potential predictors included demographic characteristics; liver disease etiology, severity, and complications; use of health care resources; comorbid conditions; and comprehensive laboratory and medication data. Patients were randomly selected for model development (66.7%) and validation (33.3%). Three different statistical and machine learning methods were evaluated: gradient descent boosting, logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization, and logistic regression with LASSO constrained to select no more than 10 predictors (partial pathway model). Predictor inclusion and model performance were evaluated in a 5-fold cross-validation. Last, the predictors identified in the most parsimonious (the partial path) model were refit using maximum-likelihood estimation (Cirrhosis Mortality Model [CiMM]), and its predictive performance was compared with that of the widely used Model for End Stage Liver Disease with sodium (MELD-Na) score.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 107â¯939 patients with cirrhosis (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [9.6] years; 96.6% male; 66.3% white, 18.4% African American), the annual mortality rate ranged from 8.8% to 15.3%. In total, 32.7% of patients died within 3 years, and 46.2% died within 5 years after the index date. Models predicting 1-year mortality had good discrimination for the gradient descent boosting (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.82), logistic regression with LASSO regularization (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.77-0.79), and the partial path logistic model (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.76-0.78). All models showed good calibration. The final CiMM model with machine learning-derived clinical variables offered significantly better discrimination than the MELD-Na score, with AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.77-0.79) vs 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.68) for 1-year mortality, respectively (DeLong zâ=â17.00; Pâ<â.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, simple machine learning techniques performed as well as the more advanced ensemble gradient boosting. Using the clinical variables identified from simple machine learning in a cirrhosis mortality model produced a new score more transparent than machine learning and more predictive than the MELD-Na score.",text mining,['ensemble']
28686117,Predicting ischemic stroke after carotid artery stenting based on proximal calcification and the jellyfish sign,"Ichinose N, Hama S, Tsuji T, Soh Z, Hayashi H, Kiura Y, Sakamoto S, Okazaki T, Ishii D, Shinagawa K, Kurisu K.",J Neurosurg. 2018 May;128(5):1280-1288. doi: 10.3171/2017.1.JNS162379. Epub 2017 Jul 7.,Ichinose N,J Neurosurg,2018,2017/07/08,,,10.3171/2017.1.JNS162379,"OBJECTIVE Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been considered to prevent ischemic strokes caused by stenosis of the cervical carotid artery. The most common complication of CAS is new cerebral infarction. The authors have previously reported that the jellyfish sign-the rise and fall of the mobile component of the carotid plaque surface detected by carotid ultrasonography-suggests thinning and rupture of the fibrous cap over the unstable plaque content, such as the lipid-rich necrotic core or internal plaque hemorrhage. The authors' aim in the present study was to evaluate the risk of a new ischemic lesion after CAS by using many risk factors including calcification (size and location) and the jellyfish sign. METHODS Eighty-six lesions (77 patients) were treated with CAS. The presence of ischemic stroke was determined using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Risk factors included calcification of the plaque (classified into 5 groups for size and 3 groups for location) and the jellyfish sign, among others. Multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise analysis and partial least squares [PLS] analysis) was conducted, followed by a machine learning analysis using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on the log-linearized gaussian mixture network (LLGMN). The additive effects of the jellyfish sign and calcification on ischemic stroke after CAS were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Steel-Dwass test. RESULTS The stepwise analysis selected the jellyfish sign, proximal calcification (proximal Ca), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and patient age for the prediction model to predict new DWI lesions. The PLS analysis revealed the same top 3 variables (jellyfish sign, proximal Ca, and LDL cholesterol) according to the variable importance in projection scores. The ANN was then used, showing that these 3 variables remained. The accuracy of the ANN improved; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the stepwise analysis, the PLS analysis, and the ANN were 0.719, 0.727, and 0.768, respectively. The combination of the jellyfish sign and proximal Ca indicates a significantly increased risk for ischemic stroke after CAS. CONCLUSIONS The jellyfish sign, proximal Ca, and LDL cholesterol were considered to be important predictors for new DWI lesions after CAS. These 3 factors can be easily determined during a standard clinical visit. Thus, these 3 variables-especially the jellyfish sign and proximal Ca-may be useful for reducing the ischemic stroke risk in patients with stenosis of the cervical carotid artery.",text mining,"['neural network', 'artificial neural network', 'diffusion']"

This article addresses the diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, and course of bipolar disorder after a manic episode as well as mania as a manifestation of neurologic disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder, especially right-sided cerebrovascular disease. Treatments (such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents) for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania. The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling, changes in gene expression, neural network interactions, and apoptosis. Except when induced by time-limited treatment with a provoking agent, mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression. Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment refractory with time, although effective treatment improves the long-term outcome.
SUMMARY: Behavioral manifestations of mania may be more obvious than affective symptoms, especially in patients with aprosodia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are often first-line acute treatments, but the evidence supporting their long-term prophylactic efficacy is questionable. In addition to being an established mood stabilizer, lithium has putative neuroprotective properties, although a side effect can be impaired memory.",text mining,['neural network']
